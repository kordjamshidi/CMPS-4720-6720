sarc,"Therefore you accept that the Republican party almost as a whole is ""grade A USDA approved Liberalism."" About time you did.   "
sarc,"More chattering from the peanut gallery? Haven't gotten the memo, you're no longer a player? Honestly....clamoring for attention is so low budget. No shame."
sarc,"Yep, suppressing natural behavior is always the way to go. We should also get them to stop pooping."
sarc,"I guess we all missed your point Justine, whatever it might have been. emoticonXConfused Better luck next time. emoticonXGood"
sarc,"Evidence, I dont need no sticking evidence. This is what I beleive, and thats it, but I will dig up some proof that supports my point."
sarc,And I would appreciate your refraining from calling your mythology a theory.
sarc,What is it that you disagree with? My statement of fact? Or the fact that I made a politically incorrect assertion? emoticonXConfused   
sarc,"Tell you what-get your math and science skills up to a grade 6 level and I'll consider taking advice from you, 'kay?  "
sarc,"In my case, it isn't 'god fearing'.. so much as ""believer fearing'"
sarc,"yeah just like you and your idols Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, etc."
sarc,"HOLY COW!!!! Is this the ""Sacred Institution of Marriage"" you and jyoshu are so fervent to protect?"
sarc,So a gun is a fire hazard in a public place? I gotta say the gun haters are getting more creative with their arguments.
sarc,"Oh gosh , a whole bunch of cut/pastes from a 14 year old that is showing off their lack of knowledge. These are not unknown situations, and are very easily explained."
sarc,"Wow, everyone's just shakin' in their boots that your imaginary god will magick them off the earth! emoticonXKillemoticonXKillemoticonXKillemoticonXBanghead"
sarc,Quite amusing that you refer to westerners as Gringos. The last time I heard that was in a film about Pancho villa!
sarc,"It looks like just Mucusaur, you and me, along with an entire thread of bots! (I'm not too sure about Mucusaur, to be honest!) ;)"
sarc,"Ah, historical inevitability. I had no idea you were a marxist, Steeeeve! Unfortunately for you the same argument applies to the collapse of capitalism. And once again you conflate capitalism and freedom. Have you never heard of anarcho-syndicalism? And why is someone more free when their life is controlled by corporations than when those corporations are restrained by a democratic government?"
sarc,"I have no idea what ""women's rights"" might be either. You could try to explain that to me while you are at it."
sarc,"Says the one who calls everyone who disagrees with him about politics a ""Bush hater"" and then cowardly runs away. emoticonXRolleyes"
sarc,You can thank Slick Willie Clinton who pushed through the sub-prime lending fiasco that eventually blew up under Bush. And gay-boy Barney Franks who oversaw the program.  
sarc,"Don't even think about contriving how gay marrige violates YOUR RIGHTS assmonkey. That's the most ludicrous, inane statement I have yet heard from the Religious Right."
sarc,"Look, the ""no one was around to see it"" argument. ""If a tree falls in the woods, and no one was around to see it, did it really fall?"" You lost this one a long time ago, too. You never learn.  "
sarc,"Well, this guy is so bad ad arguing and so good at alienating people that if we sent him into the abortion forum, it is likely, he'd be so ineffective at defending his pro-life position thathe'd actually be contributing to the pro-choice position..."
sarc,"Another red herring gay argument. Ever hear of a medical power of attorney? You don't need marriage to have one, you know. emoticonXRolleyes   "
sarc,  Anyone wanna make any bets on who the newbie is here???
sarc,"Doctor, not guy/gal. Say the words...... A doctor.   Baby is synonymous with infant. Is fetus synonymous with infant? Strange, isn't it?"
sarc,"Dude, it's, like, all over the Bible, man! Maybe if you hit your forehead with Bibles more often, you would know these things!"
sarc,"Wow, that must be some good stuff he was drinking to keep him 'under the influence' for THAT long!! :p"
sarc,Lets all make vast generalizations that are not true. Seems fun emoticonXRolleyes
sarc,That must be why they like to wear boots in Texas.
sarc,"Only those ignorant of science and evolution think that ""evolution"" has anything to do with the Bible. I guess that's because creationism is an attempt to pretend that mythology is somehow scientific and makes silly statements about science. It seems that science is somehow anti-Bible in that case when science debunks ignorance."
sarc,"So why did you say pot was worse than alcohol? Just because both are apparently bad, doesn't make one 'worse'. I'll point out that you compared the two first, so saying it's dumb to compare the two's shooting yourself in the foot."
sarc,No but it will be funny to see what sex tapes this tramp did too....
sarc,"Yes, it doesn't agree with your agenda so it must be trolling.   "
sarc,Apparently someone doesn't read. Trebor was talking about me not being jewish in the following quote.  
sarc,Probably neat excuse. Do you expect jim to back that claim up? emoticonXGood Don't hold your breath.
sarc,"We all agree that abortion is ""killing"". Killing something that has yet to become self aware is different IMO. Funny you request an open ""mind"". My point is that it ain't a human being if it ain't got no mind. That's why they unplug you when you're brain dead."
sarc,"Excuse me?! Didn't AIDS started because your homies either ate or did the nasty with monkeys, thereby crossing the species boundary? What did it have to do with ""da man""? And crime and poverty in Africa is also the white devil's doing? emoticonXConfused  "
sarc,"It probably was a bunny suit that he was supposed to wear. I guess he changed his mind, once again, and decided to wear this suit."
sarc,"THe religious reigh is not mainstream either. And frankly, you are also confusing politics and religion. You do KNOW that there is a difference? You also know there is a differnece between hateful proclimations and scholarship, don't you??"
sarc,"I'm not going anywhere with this thread. I just wanted to point out the obvious hypocrisy of everything your side represents, and nothing more. You all go right ahead and massage your shallow World views."
sarc,"Well, I guess you got something there. . . . . .can't put the cart before the hose!!"
sarc,The VPC has a political agenda. The FBI? That is like saying I believe Coke taste better than Pepsi because the Coke commericial says so.
sarc,"So what you're saying is that by mentioning both in the same post, I'm saying that unless someone is a YEC then they aren't a christian? Because that is what you attributed to me. Yet you have yet to post evidence of me saying that to anyone. Nor have you supported your original claim here, you said this: Last I checked, no credible fossil fuel firm hired YEC geologists. Prove this assertion since you researched it thoroughly enough to start a thread about."
sarc,We came from apes not created. Why can't people figure that out did any body go to school around here.
sarc,"So, how many unborn babies did your God drown in Genesis? Talk about hypocrisy."
sarc,"Not only would I throw the switch, I'd pay the electric bill, too. emoticonXGood"
sarc,Stick with the bass guitar. emoticonXRolleyes   And if you break a string....TRY not to blame it on Clinton. :p
sarc,Over the Internet that can be a particularly difficult call...
sarc,"Why would I want lies , deceptions and superstition? I mean, if believing in Jesus makes people act like you, NO THANKS"
sarc,"Because the NY Times, CNN, ABC, Dan Rather, and Handgun Control are all atheist-lead and anti-Christianity. Yeah."
sarc,"Well, when the people who market prayer come up with evidence that it works as described, let us know! As a meditation technique, it might work fine, who knows, but then, so do many other methods.  "
sarc,"Buy stock in the failing banks? What a great investment. Tell me, where does the money come from?"
sarc,"I'll let you know if or when I'm ignoring you, O Hell-bound spawn of Satan."
sarc,"so if right now, i ask god for forgivness, someone kills me, i will go to heaven by default? makes sense to me, i mean, i dont have time to sin..."
sarc,"Not quite sure what you are talking about, Iangb. And I really don't have time to crack the code so if you have a specific question, just ask it already."
sarc,"  Are you being dense on purpose? I said that I'm not all into the semantics of baby/fetus. I'll conceid that its killing a baby. The TERM for it is fetus, fetus' become babies. I see the logic there (in fact I think I'm agreeing with you). Why must you keep pounding this drum?  "
sarc,"When do you advocate breeding blond haired, blue eyed citizens to purify the US?"
sarc,"that's right, i don't want ANOTHER parental figure to tell me what to do, when to do it, and how to do it."
sarc,...or we could feed the criminals to the dinosaurs!...save the cows for meatloaf.
sarc,You question others sources and credibility yet you parade around under the name of a giant cartoon Shake?
sarc,"* - edit: you know, actually, evidence in the form of experimental results are reviewed, or at least the methods are reviewed, and then if the experiment isn't reproducible then the evidence becomes suspect, so in that light evidence is, sort of, reviewed. Eh, who cares?)"
sarc,And yet here we are and neo-Darwinism continues to have empirical support right and left with no sign of it being falsified in sight as of yet. Why might that be? And you Bertvan do not exist since you are so highly improbable. Therefore I can safely assume that your post above just happened without your existense.
sarc,"Said like a lazy, ignorant person who would rather live off the sweat of others than go out and earn for himself."
sarc,"Yeah, so will slaves who don't know their Biblical place under their masters, and women who don't submit to men."
sarc,So you haven't got an answer to the question and prove that you are 'busted'.. That's OK...as long as we can all see that.
sarc,You wouldn't. More likely you'll pursue your Wiccan follies until Judgment Day and then wonder what hit you.
sarc,"If I had said that, I would have been wrong. But the fact is that I didn't say that. You seem to have a problem in undertanding English. Let me help. Here is what I said:  "
sarc,It is also enough for me to realize you people are using words without definitions.   
sarc,Yeah. It's snowing sooner here in the Midwest. I think the next Ice Age is coming.
sarc,"Yeeees, that's why option 4 as I wrote it says ""reinterpret"" as opposed to ""reject.""   Having a bad reading day, eh?"
sarc,It also isn't a baby yet either. It is called a fetus.
sarc,You already screwed them over when you decided to cover their country in radioactive dust. Depleted uranium is a real bitch.  
sarc,"You know my answer: There is no god and no one ""created"" mankind. But the discussion over the existence of god belongs rightly under ""Religious"" or ""Philosophy"" section, not abortion.   Is this one of the tactics you fundies frequently practice? Change the subject when you are about to lose?"
sarc,"No, you at least need a sling shot and ball bearings, lol."
sarc,And you are only trying to earn yourself brownie points in hell.
sarc,"And like I said, your opinion is worth exactly NOTHING. emoticonXRolleyes"
sarc,"Are you kidding me?! You think that blacks living in Third World Carribean and African countries are ""content?!"" They're starving by the tens of thousands per day or living so far below the poverty level that it's unimaginable. Maybe you should wander off the beach sometime and see for yourself.  "
sarc,The horsehoe bend was cretaed by the flood in the image of the immaculate horseshoe. repent heathen!
sarc,"  I know, maybe the American criminals will just import guns in with their Mexican illegal drugs. I don't know for sure but I believe the Mexican Drug gangs wouldn't mind another revenue stream. Net results, Zilch, nada, zero. But you know that! emoticonXSmilie Gun control is nothing but a scam!"
sarc,"Careful now, Simone. A lesser man might report you to the moderator.;)  "
sarc,If the same question had been posed by different polls over time it would be easier to draw trends from the responses..... but good luck with finding some trends in amongst that lot.
sarc,"Ah, the esteemed Washington Times, the rag of that Korean Reverend who does the mass marriages and other weird stuff--um, what's his name now?"
sarc,Haaaaa Haaaaa Haaaaaaah haahhhha HAhaaaa. My GOD I can't stop laughing Heeee Haaaa.
sarc,Well you wouldn't have to 5hit yourself everytime you walked down the streets if you had a gun yourself.
sarc,"Your problem is that you take the Bible as the Literal Word of the Invisible man which everyone with a brain knows it is NOT. There are other ""Sins' listed in the old testament that you ignore and try to explain away but you know as well as I that Jesus did not change the Laws. If you want others to live by your False book of fairy tales it would be a Good Idea for you to read it and follow it yourself first. Choosing one or two scriptures and using them to attack people is only making you look foolish.  "
sarc,Good news. It seems as time goes on Arizona attempts to become more and more intolerant and bigoted. Thankfully he put an end to this one (too bad not the immigration one).
sarc,Once again archie squirms when the definition of regime is pointed out to him and it nullifies his claims.........
sarc,Two Vikings on one board? Time to beat a hasty retreat before I'm pillaged emoticonXChicken
sarc,"Once again, you have attempted to use the Bible to further your agenda and have been found lacking. emoticonXRolleyes   "
sarc,So you are saying that we determine our DNA? Do you actually think before typing?
sarc,"Ha.a.a.a :p emoticonXGood Good one, sinjin.  What is the sound of one hand clapping.....?  Ladywolf,  Your answer will probably come from many different sources. Your idea that it evolved is pretty-much it, IMO."
sarc,"Oh, look, removing a quote from its context. How about your address my textbook definition next?  "
sarc,"Only some? what's this then:  hxxp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Pakicetus_(1).jpg  Replace the xx with tt in case you're wondering why I put the link up like that, it's the stupid post count thingy."
sarc,"Is this a rational statement? If so, prove it rationally, by science."
sarc,Let me return the kindness. The correct spelling is ==> especially   
sarc,It is only difficult to sort out if you are a neocon and fail to recognize that neocons are nothing but militant liberals.   Bush was BY FAR the most liberal president we have had for at least 20 years.   Maybe you need to research traditional conservative values.
sarc,"What, pray, is a real answer? Because, you know, if it is anything like a corrcect answer you are doing a rather poor job of it, mate."
sarc,The riddles continue? emoticonXConfused Wouldn't it have taken less time and have been less ambiguous if you or Dr Spock just posted the # of the post?emoticonXRolleyes emoticonXRolleyes
sarc,My pursuit of happiness is denied by trees existing. Let's burn them down and destroy the environment. It's much better than me being unhappy.
sarc,"Pathetic, why would you let anyone besides yourself determine who you call family? Nobody is forcing their religion on you. Nobody is even saying who you can or can't get married to. What is being said is that you, or anyone else, doesn't have the ""right"" to have that marriage recognized by gov't. Universal recognition by gov't doesn't even happen in hetro marriages. Nowhere in the founding documents of this nation does it say ""All gov't entities shall recognize all people's marriages"". Since we have ""a government for the people by the people"", the duties of government not spelled out in the founding documents are determined by the people. You have the freedom to vote your beliefs and so does everybody else."
sarc,"Of course I can't. Can you guarantee that the apparent mugging about to happen isn't some poor slob about to ask directions?   Big guy, dark parking lot, bang bang. Better safe than sorry, eh?"
sarc,"Yup. Give me an example of a true inaccuracy, instead of working to poke fun. Do you honestly think anyone will take you seriously (except the evolutionists) if you don't provide reasons for your apparent problem with scriptures. Are you scared because you see the ""ancients"" commenting on subjects you thought science had ""discovered"" since the ""enlightenment""? Man, how arrogant can you get? You remind me of the Pharasees. Arrogant presuppositions are no substitue for confronting your ignorance my friend. Either explain how the Bible speaks accurately on sophisticated subjects as given above, or don't bother posting."
sarc,"Hmmm, a mere human-mother cannot make decisions concerning her own body, but you, sk8joyful, can usurp the position of God and tell another human, especially a mere human-mother, what she is allowed to do with her body."
sarc,"Me, too. I'd probably throw in some counseling as well, just for starters."
sarc,"Including the mentally ill, those with previous violent felonies, and children?"
sarc,"And here is the crux of the matter where I think Libertarians are missing it: As one Founding Father said, ""There can be no liberty without virtue."" Someone else once said, ""Intemperate men can never be free because their passions give rise to their bindings"".   If the God of the Bible is right, a nation which legalizes sin and intemperance loses the favor of God. And when the sins of a nation reach their fullness (in God's eyes), that disfavor can turn to judgment (Genesis 15:16, Deuteronomy Chapter 28 - ""The blessings of obedience and curses of disobedience). Therefore, while many of the Libertarians mean well on liberal social issues, they nevertheless either don't see the big picture, or they don't believe it will occur."
sarc,If it isn't so hard then why haven't you found it yet? I am still waiting and you becoming cocky is not helping you.
sarc,"Good point here, because the media never insults right-wingers....emoticonXRolleyes   I don't think anybody is denying that Imus' comments were tasteless and offensive. The point that is being made here is that he has the right to make such comments. He didn't discriminate against anyone. He simply said something stupid. If this is going to be considered a crime, we would all be locked away."
sarc,"Well then, using just the Bible, what is the value of pi to the third decimal point?"
sarc,"Nice spin. Would you have preferred ""the civilized world"" instead? Or Western Civilization or Gay Western Civilization? Your preference? One case in 1959 isn't a pandemic.   "
sarc,"Oh spare me the condemnation ya' XXXX-hard. You aren't interested in saving souls. If you were, you would bother to have payed attention to the countless times you have been told that your abrasive, insulting tactics DON'T WORK.   Plus an eternity in hell or an eternity with a terroristic God? I think I will stick with being able to live with myself for even today, let alone an eternity.  "
sarc,"The fact that you think the 9-9-9 plan is good only proves you are as stupid as Herman Cain is. Maybe you and Grover Norquist can get with Herman Cain and start construction on Utopian dreamworld, and don't forget to stop by and pick up your other dumbass Ron Paul on your way ."
sarc,"This just goes to prove that these nasty gays are maliciously infiltrating the military far more than we suspected (anyone would think they want to defend the country or something). But no, they just want to infect them with nasty squiggly crawly things. EEeew!! Look the SEALS must be a bunch of raving deviants. Quick, club the lot of them before this thing spreads.emoticonXRolleyes   Er . . . *puts down burning cross and slinks into shadow*"
sarc,"He didn't pursue the ""master race of white Protestant."" He was a pure Aryanist, genius one. The very least you could do is get your facts straight, but you probably like spreading this bullcrap on purpose. (Seeing as how you're an atheist.)"
sarc,"Yeah guess that probably makes me a gun-toten redneck drunk,shooten everything in sight huh.emoticonXKillemoticonXGood"
sarc,And you're accusing him of not debating properly? That's the best you can do?
sarc,You mean like how you suck any rationale thought or discourse from a debate topic? Talk about ABORTING.
sarc,"I thought you had vowed never to post in this forum again. ????? I suppose with your views on divorce, your wedding vows have as much weight as your vow not to post here."
sarc,"Wow that worked well. Please explain where his logic is flawed in the point he made. You cant, because its not. This just proves how much this ""point"" along with all your other arguments have ""flaws in logic"" if you will."
sarc,Find me a mass shooting in Utah where concealed carry on campus is legal.
sarc,"****! I go to Home Depot, have a basic understanding of car maintenance, love to fish, always wear sensible shoes and will frequently go without make-up. I never knew I was a XXXX. Man if I can't get my stereotypes right, I guess I will just have to give up my crush on the cute dude guitar player I saw last night..... :p"
sarc,This is from an article I read on it...so if we just get a bunch of aerosol spray cans we can combat any warming emoticonXGood
sarc,"I guess I am just ""psychologically conditioned"" to be blue eyed.?"
sarc,No I can't marry them becasue some of them are married. Also none have intent to li ve within Mass.
sarc,"Um no... It's the truth... Um, I guess it was sarcasm, but I don't think that would be something that you would understand."
sarc,"I suppose if you Truly Believe its not dishonest to repeat anothers ideas as if they were your own. I will keep this in mind the next time I have to write a paper. Woe betide any professor who accuses me of plagiarism, for he is trampling my religious freedoms!  "
sarc,"Pure conjecture on your part. As a father of three, I have as much vested interest in my kids as my wife has. To suggest otherwise is BS. But, maybe you don't understand that because you haven't walked a mile in a father's shoes. emoticonXRolleyes"
sarc,I feel a No True Scotsman coming on. Should I even bother to mention Hovind?
sarc,I won't waste my time with trolls here. Do you have anything useful to say?
sarc,"I see you've met my stalker. Lovely soul, isn't s/he? ;)"
sarc,That's like looking at a rainbow and insisting it only has the color red in it.  
sarc,"Actually, breeding horses and donkeys isn't an effort to create a new species. Where did you get such a thoughtless idea. And neither is interbreeding lions and tigers. However, you don't seem to be aware that neither ligers or tigons are sterile. They are capable of breeding with each other or with either of the parent species. And then there are polar bears and brown bears, which can and will interbreed if given the opportunity. And the offspring are perfectly fertile."
sarc,You really are an idiot if you think China follows Jefferson
sarc,"Come now, VoR. Everyone knows that the French would never fight another country.....by themselves. emoticonXRolleyes"
sarc,"Is it not extremely cold at 35,000 feet? Did he not suffer from hypothermia due to the extreme cold at 35,000 feet? Did he not fall from the sky and break near all his bones when the wheel well opened for landing after a lengthy flight at 35,000 feet? Do I have to give you the flight number and type of airplane in order to get my stuffed animal circus prize?"
sarc,"Well are there 4 or are there none? What about the Archaeopteryx lineage, why do you keep avoiding the question by changing the subject? It's no wonder scientists get annoyed with creationists."
sarc,"Really. If that's being ""saved,"" I prefer to go down with the Titanic."
sarc,"Sheeple never understand where money comes from nor do they know cliffs even exist. Full bellies, breeding, mindless entertainment and a government sheppard are their sole requirements."
sarc,"Already busted, Mr. Trebor. Went in one eye and out the other. Come back when you have something other than generalized rhetoric."
sarc,"He wasn't trying to. Shooterandproud may be an unreasonable gun nut, but he accepts evolution."
sarc,"No, you wouldn't have. I'd have a better chance of winning the lottery without buying a ticket."
sarc,"Well since Bush took office the mantra has bee ""Local Control"" has it not. Apparently the people of your state want whats happening. Local control in action. Rejoice in your victory."
sarc,"B.S. simone. He was the perfect age for Vietnam. Why hasn't he released his draft card? I know, they only sent them to citizens."
sarc,So which argument do you want to stick with/ The one above that says the black vote was irrelevent or your previous argument in which you claimed was significant. I'll refresh your memory::  
sarc,"Well, we have our head in the sand in more ways than one."
sarc,You are so FUN. Its amazing to hear you say this considering how much you applaud a law that pretty much allows this in Arizona.

sarc,"How about not clicking the ""reply "" button twice (heh,heh,) No, we didn't (Thank goodness) AND! PM Blair is recanting from the Kyoto protocol. Bully for him!"
sarc,I have no problem with them preaching against gays in their churches and the privacy of thier homes. Its when they crawl out from under their rocks that I have a problem. I also have absolutly no problem what so ever with them talking about Jesus if only they would keep to the subject of Jesus and leave all gay issues alone. Unfortually Paul has replaced Jesus in many churches.
sarc,"Aaahhh, so just not accomplishing our goals and going home is not defeat, there has to be paperwork for it to be a defeat. Gotcha.   "
sarc,"And you wonder why people call ""republicans"" racist, women hating bigots. (hint: it's comments like yours)"
sarc,In England we have a sack with a couple of bricks inside it.

sarc,"I can't convert you JSD, only Christ can. But you must be open to Him and His Spirit for that to happen so don't be looking to me to save you. And you may think I'm self deluted, as in somehow watered down, but you are self deluded as in completely entrenched in your bigotry and ignorance of what is right and true. But thanks for judging me. I welcome it. :p"
sarc,This is a laughable oversimplication of reproduction. Humans don't make copies. Do you reproduce asexually? I know I don't.
sarc,"Don't forget that he's the anti-Christ and wants to starve Seniors and ""babies"". That's part of the DNC mantra too. emoticonXRolleyes"
sarc,"Yes, we should have a speedier route to the needle. If we miss a few, send a few innocent people to their deaths, no harm no foul."
sarc,"You are, in effect, telling me that putting someone in a position that will inevitable leave them dead does not make you responsible for their death. If I fire a bullet at your head, while that bullet is in mid-air, I am no longer doing anything to hurt you, and you are fine. However, I have set in motion affects that will result in your demise. This makes me responsible for your death."
sarc,"And the scientific papers don't. The problem here is that creationists don't read the scientific papers. In fact, most can't even understand them."
sarc,Oh what a shame! Especially if it's true! Where did you get the idea that ID theory is not based on evidence and/or testing?
sarc,I sincerely doubt any of that happened. If so you would have links. Yea we know you are cyber brave to the point of heroine status. You are a troll pure and simple.
sarc,"Ok, if Max is a hillbilly for his punctuation, then you, Ray, aspire to hillbilly-hood! Max hitting some typos while talking about other's intelligence was funny . You going after someone's English is just plain ludicrous! Do you really not know how awful your writing is?"
sarc,I am un-aware of a conservative nazi party. Did Howard Dean tell you this?
sarc,"Yes, necessarily for YOUR genocidal rantings. But not for actual reality.  "
sarc,"Hey, it's the same god, just older. The birth of his son mellowed him out, you know,.. made him think about the future more, and have to worry about responsibility and all that stuff."

sarc,"Yes when not hailing jesus, he likes to leave droppings here and there about the boards ..."
sarc,"Nice try. Now, tell me how atheists are paying for ""Christian benefits""? Do Canadians give money to people based on their religion? They surely don't here in the States. I can only collect SS if I pay into the system. My employer AND I pay for my family's healthcare. As for their tax-free status, I would have no problem removing it...just as I'd love to see the ACLU and other crackpot liberal organizations lose their tax-exempt status. emoticonXGood   "
sarc,Oh vey! Vat du they say about the U.S. Marshals service committing more crimes than people they have actually arrested for a crime?
sarc,So you are an expert in this like you were about the economics of sending money out of the country?  The problem with letting people like you call the shots is that you really have no idea what you are talking about.  It's something I see in a lot of conservatives.
sarc,Yes I apologize for your ignorance and your inability to 'get it'....   
sarc,"But in all reality an embryo is inside a uterus, living solely through a placenta and a two month old baby is not. That is a significant difference. One may argue how significant, but it is silly to say the only difference is time."
sarc,"That's good - so you no longer believe all actions that result in inevitable deaths are killings, only cruel ones. This is an improvement on your previous:  "
sarc,"Yes, but if true it would certainly make the investigation go easier and the repair of other bridges faster and cheaper. Ban gay marriage - your bridges never collapse - imagine that!"
sarc,And then you can go pat yourself on the back and pretend it's all better. I hope your personal comfort level will be worth the havoc that will be brought upon the lives of women.
sarc,"That is the greatest monologue in the history of Earth. Instead of a resume, I will just fax this to my next prospective employer.   Great stuff."
sarc,When's the last time you heard of someone being killed by the accidental discharge of a fire extinguisher? Or when the last time a fire extinguisher was stolen from a home and then used in the commission of a crime? And don't you think the likelihood of being in a car accident is greater than that of being required to shoot someone?
sarc,You seem to require a slick answer to a complicated question - so how about this:  Question: Was Stalin a communist ?  Answer: That's what he said he was.  Hope this is glib and vacuous enough to meet with your exacting standards.
sarc,"I'm sorry, did Article V have a clause I'm missing that says you can only amendment the constitution if it accomplishes more freedom? Is there anywhere in the history of that provision that supports this? Can you point to ANYTHING that supports your incorrect viewpoint?   "
sarc,"And isn't it time that the Bush haters on the opposite side of the argument quit spreading lies about the constitutionality of the law? I'm sick of unsubstantiated liberal blather, aren't you? emoticonXRolleyes"
sarc,So all of this ballyhoo and really you've changed nothing? emoticonXConfused   The entire system of inheritance and wills would still be in place.  
sarc,"Except for, ya know, like the whole Old Testament.   False testament: archaeology refutes the Bible's claim to history"
sarc,"Hey that cheeseburger is on me,and make sure it has extra  rat poison!"
sarc,"Yep, so much for a pastor knowing his sheep(le).  It's no wonder that they aren't noticed when they go missing.  What ever happened for the shepherd going out and seeking his lost sheep to bring them back to the fold???  As to this case.  I mentioned earlier about Rick Warren (author of A Purpose Driven Life)...he doesn't have armed guards in his mega church.  But, then again, he's not a fleecing WofF in shepherds clothing who seeks to ravenously devour a flock."
sarc,Come on down to skid row with the rest of us 'lower class' I'll even buy a bottle of MD 20/20 on me.  
sarc,"The last known passenger pigeon died in 1914. Your attempt to inflame the discussion fails on the grounds of utter stupidity. Might as well be asking if he bagged a tasmanian tiger, or a chupacabra, or the mothman."
sarc,"Well if you already know you're for guns, then you should know the basic reasons, right? Or was this an uninformed decisions (I heard from my friend that guns are good)? But basically other people have said it. They're protected by the Constitution, they generally result in lower crime rates, and they can be used for defense as well as hunting. Oh, but the burden of proof isn't on the people supporting guns, but those who wish to ban guns. Most arguments for banning guns are easily refutable."
sarc,"The vast majority of scientists do not believe in Creationism, and all those people you listed who say there are only 2 varients evolution or creationism--they are't anthropological or theological experts. All they know is their westernized view. Their opinions have no reflection on Biology in that sense. THey should stick to Biology. There is only 1 true way--that's evolution. THe other's are wishful thinking, whether they be the primordial flood, the divine parrot, or magic god who made people from dust."
sarc,Do you think that red herrings and strawmen will help your case? ;)
sarc,"Well nobody has turned up the Ark have they, termites could assure that if properly used. After 40 days and more they would be ravenous."
sarc,they held a big bash in honor of sluttish welfare queen Ayn Rand:  
sarc,"Oh, I think you take delight in spelling it out in excruciating detail. Otherwise, you'd reply on point.  "
sarc,And you know he is NATO's boy how? You get a bit more looney with each post there comic relief. Keep the laffs coming tho.
sarc,"Good, associate yourself with him. After all, having a best pal who weaves a web of contridictions and lies can't hurt you right?"
sarc,Who is this god you speak of? Can I call him? I have some things I'd like done and he can just say them while on the phone I'm hoping.  -Mach
sarc,"Oh but he is different in the mule's tiny mind. The Southern Baptist types are Christian and so uphold the mule's way of life, so it's alright for them to call for mass death."
sarc,"So, in your scenario, Prototype, are you anti-choice folk going to force us who believe in choice, who believe that a woman owns her very own body, are you going to place us in re-education jails so that we, too, believe that a fertilized egg is a human being?"
sarc,"No. I'll type slowly so I don't get ahead of you this time. Follow with your finger and move your lips if no one is watching. Scientists get to define what they mean by the scientific words that they use. Not you and not your preacher. Do I get to define what you mean by the word ""prayer?"" Why not?"
sarc,"Hang in here everyone, Bassman's been reading ""_____""'s posts over and over and they've got him talking about the ""American Holocaust""! emoticonXBanghead   Until you have been in my exact situation, I wouldn't expect someone like you to understand. I really don't give a emoticonXCensored if you think it is selfish or not - it is not for you to judge."
sarc,"No, but I read some of the evidence and it looked pretty solid. If this person was sentenced to life in prison without parole would you question the verdict?"
sarc,"Look what is talking about insane, immune to reason, a prisnor of his own giant ignorance, slavery fetishist and one of the comic relief 3 stooges. You might have a dialogue but then insult isn't part of one. No one gives a rat's patoot about your opinion. If it were your country maybe they would but I doubt it. Mean while eat your heart out as you rail in fear about us buying and keeping arms."
sarc,But how can we make rules without legal lines in sand? At least its better than an illegal line.
sarc,I thought it was at the bottom of a large body of water.
sarc,"Death might not bother you, but the afterlife is going to be a real killer!"
sarc,"Dude, you only figured that out now?   I'm disappointed in you.   just joking. Everything he states has a hidden agenda."
sarc,Are there many liberal democrat left wing thinking born again Christians? Weird huh?
sarc,I can tell that you dismissed the post below that. And I feel I can assume that you didn't read it. Odd that a paranoid conspiracy theorist / communist who concluded that communism has never led to dictatorship should accuse me of being a fanatic.
sarc,Really?! Wow! You must know only hardcore pro-lifers. I'm a pro-lifer who believes in birth control and I can rattle the names of about a zillion others who share my opinion. emoticonXWow
sarc,And you have a right to cling to superstition and magic as true. But that doesn't make mythology true.
sarc,"Your definition of ""Godly wisdom"" is agreeing with your political positions and your spurious theological justifications for them, so it's hardly surprising you don't encounter any liberals who you think have ""Godly wisdom"""
sarc,"Funny, I thought Heribert Nilsson was a botanist. Don't let little details like that get in your way though."
sarc,"Here you are using the misogynist POV. No ""Rushspeak"" if you please.  "
sarc,"Why doesn't this apply to Soviet Russia - which had a population of similar size ? Presumably, your answer would be that the USSR was less ""developed"" than the US ?"
sarc,"April was ""recent"" ? Please provide evidence from the memo of these ""examples""."
sarc,"No need for further evidence why this law would be dangerous to those who do not think exactly like you do!   Instead of calling it a government terrorist watch list, we should just drop the pretension and call it what it would be come. The Democrat Political Enemies Terrorist Wish List! :lol:   Bloomberg: Deny Second Amendment to People on Terror Watch List"
sarc,"Oh, it gave me quite a shock when that happened! I wasn't expecting it at all! emoticonXRolleyes"
sarc,You just had to bring Godwin into didn't you. >_>   Besides what good is a corpse? Nevermind you're never going to understand my logic so I might as well not waste the time.
sarc,Oh . . . please be gentle with me. Whew! :p   
sarc,Well then the courts must be insane. Because I'm sure there are some gun control laws that they're struck down due to their ineffectiveness.
sarc,"How do they use ""the empirical evidence prove it"", when they do no research, and no evidence actually supports their ""theory""?"
sarc,"Fundies don't say do as I say, not as I do. We say do as God says, not as I do. There's a huge difference."
sarc,Oh! Goody! At last someone who wants to actually discuss evolution instead of mythology!
sarc,Poor little poopie.   If your gay sex agenda wasn't of the devil himself you might be better received in the world.
sarc,"If science deals with how information is gathered, different ways of analyzing, and different hypothesis, then it involves worldviews. The base for the worldview of a sizable part of the population should not be excluded. Maybe in Saddam Hussien's Iraq, maybe in communist Russia, but not in the United States."
sarc,It ok if one persons bottle is bigger or do they kinda have to be roughly equal in size? really.
sarc,"With a standing president breaking the law to 'protect' you, this should be expected."
sarc,"Was that so hard? Anti gay Christians do want gays to oppose their, marriages, discriminate against them, oppose christians from being able to adopt, and practice thier religion. Since anti gay christians are doing all these things to gay people then that is how they want gay people to treat christians."
sarc,Would it be the lawless Cardinal Law officiating at one of the funerary masses for JPII and otherwise serving in a prominent role in all the pomp and circumstance surrounding the pope's death?
sarc,Then what's Mississippi's problem? They must be run by a-holes because they are being forgotten.  
sarc,"Really? Then why did you start off your little rant by admitting that ""...microevolution cannot be reasonably disputed."" Evolution has been observed, and that is a fact. Speciation in both plants and animals has been observed, and that is a fact. Apparently you don't know what a theory is. Might it not be wise to learn just a little about science before you make yourself look so foolish? Theories explain facts."
sarc,Really. Have you got any quotes from them endorsing monopolies?
sarc,Appears a lot of sensible folks are investing in their 401G and 401A plans ;)
sarc,I didn't know neanderthals like you and Mr. Grimm had the social graces to know what to do with toilet paper.
sarc,But you still feel they have the right idea when it comes to firearms?
sarc,"...? Either you've misread what I said, twisted what I said, or you're just stupid."
sarc,"And we all know when you say ""We"" you mean your buddies the Mormons and their Money are the ones voting down such bills.. It's just a matter of time before people start to wake up. Once they realize they've been duped by an invisible man they'll do the right thing and give gay people their rights.  "
sarc,"I'm a redneck because, unlike you, I believe in self-determination?! emoticonXWow"
sarc,Oh. Then you're just a dupe rather than being dishonest. Your information comes from a moonie. Funny that the Discovery Institute doesn't mention that. The fact that he decided to study biology with the express purpose of disproving evolution. So he had made up his mind that it was wrong before he undertook to find out what is was. Wells was encouraged by the Rev. Moon. He is known selective presentation of data.
sarc,"Numbers don't lie, unless they come out of the mouth of a Politican."
sarc,You're lying to yourself.. So I'll just keep letting you know until the cloud of delusion dissipates.  
sarc,Deliberate deception would be putting million year old dinosaur bones on a thousand year old planet. Even more deceiving would be putting vast amounts of oil here as well which takes millions of years to create. I would put the stars in the sky in the same category as this in terms of deception. The stars could be more of a cosmetic thing as far as God is concerned. He could have just added them to our sky without concern for whether it made sense or not. I personally wouldn't fault him for this.
sarc,"Actually the defending of ATF wouldn't do much with regular guns since they have little to do with them. ATFs function is with NFA guns, which you probably know little, or nothing about."
sarc,"Because there couldn't possibly be any undetected illegal gun trafficking, could there be?  "
sarc,WOW and the republicans would never do anything like that now would they.......They would never impeach a president over a BJ now would they?
sarc,"Where is your ""proof"" that a magical being in the Heavens created us ?"
sarc,"If we could rub a brass lamp, make three wishes and fix our energy problems immediately, I'd agree with you. But since we live in the REAL WORLD, we must become OIL INDEPENDENT while we are perfecting and building an infrastructure of renewable energy sources."
sarc,"Yeah, right, JO, socialist countries are Eden Mecca's all over the world today. No matter how many times they fail, its proponents just need another chance."
sarc,"Oh my goodness, yes. I had forgotten that scenario. How silly of me."
sarc,"So you see a cop on the streets, you see he's armed, that's enough to induce aggression and violence, possibly cause you to hurt others, simply because you saw that somebody else was armed?"
sarc,"Oh, I get it. So you believe, but you don't exactly ""believe""."
sarc,"Thats nice...Care to make an argument, or are you just op-eding my viewpoints?"
sarc,"I thought God forbid them to eat dead cows, or was it poultry ? emoticonXRolleyes"
sarc,And posts like yours serve no purpose other than to detract from the subject at hand. The subject at hand involves how some people choose to fear the law-abiding and feel safer with the law-breakers. You've done absolutely nothing to dispute these facts and prove them wrong.
sarc,"So you disagree with Zardoz then? True christians are those who profess faith and bear false witness? True christians are those who are ignorant, vain, boastful insulting liars?  Interesting..."
sarc,"The truth hurts doesn't it? They are anti my morals, anti my family, anti my equality, anti my america, and defintely homophobic and I would add one more bigot."
sarc,I am here right now brady. Doesn't look like you are doing so well. All of your claims and propaganda points a simmering ashes just like your .org soon will be. Have you got any useful skills so you can make a living? emoticonXHoho
sarc,I thought the almighty expressed his will in the Bible for mortal men to know it...
sarc,I am not the origin of anything....I originated in my parents....from where did they originate?
sarc,So you are saying that genetics has nothing to do with genetics?
sarc,"Yeah, there are quite a number of dumb Republican bureacrats running Califorhia."
sarc,"lol Seriously boring is right. Just think, no Larry Craig scandals."
sarc,"Well personally I tend to always question the intelligence of someone who believes that that a cosmic Jewish Zombie who was his own 2000 year old space god father can make you live forever if you symbolically eat his flesh and telepathically tell him you accept him as your master, so he can remove an evil force from your soul that is present in humanity because a rib-woman was convinced by a talking snake to eat from a magical tree..."
sarc,"So you are pro-life and you hate liberals? Actually Republicans are being liberal in this case (liberal=bigger government, more laws).   But I'll assume you mean Democrats on this. What if the baby is a democrat? If it's a democratic parent it's most likely it will grow up democratic and one more person to attempt to keep abortion legal."
sarc,I'd lo9ve to test your hypothesis sometime by dropping a few Democrats into a pack of wolves and seeing who survives. emoticonXSmilie
sarc,"Last time I checked most state boards merely set the guidelines, whether or not they are followed is something entirely different. Still the fact that you have a board of education spouting such ridiculousness is pretty damn amusing."
sarc,Abstinence until heterosexual marriage isn't encouraging heterosexual marriage?  I've never heard of an abstinence-until-domestic-partnership program. Perhaps you could point us to an inclusive abstinence-only program somewhere.  Perhaps not....
sarc,"So that's what, at least 4 lies in 8 days? Pretty impressive Archie. You should be on your knees asking god's forgiveness for your lies."
sarc,"I did, you rejected my evidence with your usual excuses. Now, tell me about the big bang."
sarc,"Good- we were tired of you not responding or saying, ""it isn't worth my time."""
sarc,Do you have to work at becoming so scientifically illiterate? What ever happened to the creationist chant about evolution being a product of pure chance? You seem to chant all of the other creationist tripe.
sarc,Only if you include the fact that while cleaning up the water he is beating the pipe with a hammer.
sarc,"Oh, ok, I can be politically correct if it makes you feel better. How about I refer to them as ""intelligence deficient"". And I was really not referring to bona fide ""retarded"" individuals (those with true pathology). I agree that there is nothing funny about that. How about I refer to them as people who drive like XXXXXX...Is that better?"
sarc,I've been a fan ever since your first fake hairflip goodbye. emoticonXGood
sarc,"And where, pray tell, does your un-'ignorant' system of proper behaviour come from?"
sarc,"Oh, I think they ought to creat this superstate and we Americans will REALLY have a big laugh. Go for it. I need the levity."
sarc,It was a hypothetical question that has been answered..please try to keep up.
sarc,"Really?!! I'm not aware of any kids being born to two gay biological parents (unless one is a lesbian and the other a gay man, that is).  "
sarc,"I did not know that Obama was of low IQ and a conservative, for he is most assuredly a racism and bigot."
sarc,So you support allowing a 10 y/o to buy an Uzi and carry it into a federal court house or school as long as he does not commit a crime? Wow.   And your logic about taking criminals off the street and then having no gun control concerns would be perfect...if we had a finite number of criminals. We don't. New murderers and theives and carjackers and dope dealers and bank robbers and child rapists are born every day.
sarc,Do you know why gay sex sinners refuse to repent? Because they have an idol - gay sex.
sarc,"Yes, it's been supressed. Only 14 people knew it before some brave soul tortured them until they confessed the horrible truth!!"
sarc,No I think YOU are the imbecile. And it's great to see you follow your buddy EZ and his ways.. I suppose you've been training with him for some time now.. You're almost identical twins .. give it a bit more time and we won't be able to tell you apart.
sarc,"Really, can you show me this science? You are just as genetically similiar to a white person as you are to an embryo."
sarc,How about this explanation - you're reading WAAAAAY too much into your precious Bible.
sarc,"gooey cute as this reads, how is this relevant to the philosophy discourse?"
sarc,"Yeah, the lesbians. emoticonXRolleyes It would also mean the end of the human race. emoticonXGood"
sarc,"Which is why 50 million Americans are uninsured, including 9 million children. With 27,000 from that group dying every year, as a result of ""freedom"", and unpaid hospital bills the leading cause of bankruptcy and homelessness. Also for the other 50 million who are underinsured."
sarc,"Dear Jill:  P.S. Remember, I gave you the morning after pill? Use it! Or hey make a few thousand dollars and donate it to research (cha-ching)!!  P.S.S. Thanks for the herpes! emoticonXGood And you think you have a medical problem, all you have to do is take a pill and you're done with the situation I gave you, but what about the situation you have now given me???   What's that (new) quote: All is fair in Love, sex and war? emoticonXKill   Jack"
sarc,"Kudos to Dubya! I thought that Brown was, well I don't know, INCOMPETENT!"
sarc,And yet the species that exist today are the exact same as the species during the high oxygen content? That makes little sense. It's like saying the world was vastly different before yet perfectly suited for the species that exist today. That is COMPLETELY nonsensical.   Where did all of the oxygen go?
sarc,"I believe Alan Keyes already have used that term on us.   (Alan Keyes, the ultra-concervative Republican Candidate for the Illinois Senate seat - in opposition to Barack Obama. The Maryland resident the Republican party had to recruit because they couldn't find anyone else in their right mind who would go against Barack. Also the very same Maryland resident/Television talkshow host who beratted Hilary Clinton for moving to NY and expecting to be able to ""represent"" NY'ers. Yeah, look who's the hypocrit now.)"
sarc,That would be the fault of you rather than us. Everyone knows a small mind can't see what's beyond it's comprehension level.  
sarc,Hmmm.... your religious predecessors would have sentenced you to house arrest for something so heretical.
sarc,"What case? You don't have a case, or a leg to stand on! emoticonXRolleyes"
sarc,Then God should have used someone they trusted and respected to deliver that message. emoticonXRolleyes   
sarc,"Because we have different experiences than you and are more educated on the subject. The only ones who tend to ask ""Why do you feel you need a firearm to protect yourself"" are the ones who've never faced such a situation and don't know what it's like to be in such a position."
sarc,"Back in 1967, societal view of marriage was opposite-sex. Wait ... it's STILL that way. (Seen the ballot initiatives around the country?!) The point is that letting blacks marry whites didn't fundamentally redefine marriage, because it was still between a man and a woman.  "
sarc,"So theistic evolution is not a belief, not a faith at all? It is simply a humanistic idea that is based on science, using God to fill gaps?"
sarc,"Not the same thing at all! Most gay pride floats are moade of crate paper and glue guns. Not gold. I think you have stratched this one really far. Nice try, thanks for playing. Try again soon! Wow, nicotine cravings make me a mean person!"
sarc,"Oh dear, deluded philisopher nutter alert. No one can empirically prove anything. Fact. End of discussion."
sarc,"Watch out, Jim. She believes that the only good man is a neutered man. emoticonXIc"
sarc,"WW, are you talking to yourself?  If not, then please learn how to attribute statements to the person who made them."
sarc,"No, this is the point of the 10th amendment. Article 1 Section 8 applies to Congress...the 10th amendment grants all powers not listed to the states or people.   The 14th amendment is not the ""federal government can do whatever"" amendment.   "
sarc,"Hey, someone has to clean our toilets. This may sound brutal, but one of the biggest reasons why Indians, Asians, etc all are heavy on education is because their lives sucked. They didn't get a education and they were living in poverty. Thus, they seem education, mainly the sciences and the maths as a way to escape poverty. Japanese and Chinese parents are massively strict on their kids because they want their kids of excel as the parents either were poor or grew up poor and know what that's like. This may be necessary for these religious homeschooled folks to find out. Spending a life time in poverty or working 3 jobs to make ends meet will change someone's view point on education."
sarc,ROFLMAO! Nice way of restating the 'inaccurate' statement basically the same way.
sarc,So biology didn't exist before the theory of evolution was formulated?
sarc,"And this coming from a so called, self proclaimed ""rational christian"" ? It appears you have blown your cover as a poser by showing your true colors as an anti-christian atheist and a hatemonger. Thanks for revealing your true Nature. emoticonXGood"
sarc,Hollow bones however when equipped with wings allow for greater flight distance.
sarc,"LOL! Aye, Lad, you're lucky that I'm not in my Berserker mood today!"
sarc,Most certainly. The fact that you think that it is unnecessary only underlines your ignorance. Why don't you discuss beetle lungs for us. Those are organs necessary for the survival of both bears and cheetahs. How about livers. Same story. Thyroid? Pituitary? Pancreas? Go for it.
sarc,Your extremist views are surfacing. It's likely you'd rather follow California into the pits of wierdism.
sarc,"Oh, i thought ""bullet"" was some sort of slang term. Never mind."
sarc,"Ok genius, explain to me how come it is that I dont believe in monsters, in ghosts,in luck,the tooth fairy, the easter bunny, and so many other things that a lot of people believe in, but yet I believe in God. Do I have some deep seated delusional fantasy or something like that. You seem to be wise and all knowing( maybe all powerfull as well). Yep, im convinced you are a legend in your own mind. You believe what you will, and I will do the same, and in the end we will see who is right and who is not."
sarc,"I just linked you to it. (You do understand how amendments work, yes?) Note the ""to lay.""  "
sarc,"Except that the government was tapping phones, and isn't interfering with freedom of speech. But if you ignore reality, then your parallel kinda works, I guess."
sarc,"Hardy, har har! It is nice to see sinjin is still ""hanging"" around :)"
sarc,"So, Steeeeve, I take it you are not for a FAIR society?   Is an unfair society a moral society? Please explain. I find it difficult to comprehend."
sarc,"Why not, after all, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. emoticonXRolleyes   Waxy"
sarc,"Well, either the real or imaginary Phyllis implied those things in the post under discussion."
sarc,"Well, you got that one exactly right. I didn't bother to watch your video. It was pretty predictable coming from you - personal attacks on creationists. I quoted YOU because of what YOU said."
sarc,"If we did not have criminals, we wouldnt have ""shoot outs"" as you so call them."
sarc,Ever see someone try to kill you?that can causes paranoia also.emoticonXRolleyes
sarc,"  I guess I SHOULD give you some time to mourn, so go back and dry your snot"
sarc,"Interestingly everyone but 'the left' can assimilate what is being said, however, the left is notorious for their ever-present attitude that everyone else is mindless. You don't got no brownie points....."
sarc,I see. So you actually reject all of science and still are willing to use a computer and the Internet. Don't you know that you are being led astray by your IBM processor?
sarc,"If you can't prove or deal in absolutes, then the basis of your argument, the ""absolute"" nature of logic, just became pretty shaky."
sarc,"How about you post all the "" Great Amount"" of evidence concerning the Gospel Mythology. The fact that you don't even bother to read the actual information and form an argument tells me you have nothing......"
sarc,"I think that might mean that you should shut your trap about other people and not pass judgement on them (i.e. Carl Sagan right here in this topic, etc.). What do you think?"
sarc,"But AA's not responsible for that, because he is an A-rab."
sarc,"Hey Matt, if that paintbrush were any broader, you could paint a room in just five minutes"
sarc,">_> one would think pulling the power, breaking into someone's house, and having raped her once and been reported would have been proof enough.   What do you want a video of him raping her or something?"
sarc,You mean other than the fact that Mr. Pocketwatch and Mrs. Pocketwatch don't meet up for a night of whoopee and end up with little baby pocketwatches some time later? How about: I know that humans manufacture pocketwatches.
sarc,"Kill or be killed, survival of the fittest? No compassion, the rule of tooth and fang? WOW, color me impressed!"
sarc,"Great job straight out of the leftard playbook. Can't refute the message so go after the messenger. Would it matter if it was printed in the NY Slimes, I doubt it."
sarc,So being easy to know makes it good? methinks that's not quite right.
sarc,"I suppose Piltdown Man was the product of newspapers, cute indeed!"
sarc,"Yet another non-response. (We're not going to have to start counting these, are we?) It fails to address your dilemma of the ""just are"" theories.  "
sarc,"I've decided that I will answer this question once and for all if someone can prove to me why people need tennis racquets. If someone can answer this for me, I will attempt the definitive assault weapon response. Have at it."
sarc,So do you think that the earth is hundreds of millions of years old?
sarc,"You mean you're for real? You're not setting out deliberately to make creationists look as if they don't know what they're talking about? Because that's all you're achieving.  Still no source for the trillions, I see."
sarc,"I was under the impression that he was referencing the video...since he always interchanges the words embryo and fetus I just rolled with it.   Secondly, an embryo does have instructions for a brain...while a plant does not. I guess the answer hear depends on the ever evolving definition of ""mental existence""."
sarc,"You mean you are as biologically ignorant and as easily refuted as the thread originator? Yes, we knew that already. Why all the big letters?"
sarc,"Oh no. The main disagreement between theistic evolutionists and Fundmentalists is that Fundies aren't worshipping God, but a false idol of their own making."
sarc,Yeah yeah whatever and there are gay catholics also. The point is that the vast majority of baptists are the <term that has been banned>
sarc,"You mean Priests? Because I hear the ladies are crawling all over them, can't get enough of that catholic loving..."
sarc,"You know, I've seen this BS from you quite often. Is your life sour? Do you need to make other peoples lives as miserable as you can just so you can get through the day?"
sarc,"how about small cute animals? whare is the line of what religion allows, and law forbids? we know it is not where harm comes to another person, or poligamy would be legal"
sarc,"And refusing to donate your resources is killing, so I have killed someone by not donating my blood etc.  "
sarc,"So, is a giant Panda a bear? Or some other ""kind""?"
sarc,"Interesting, this is the same type of angry rants that Capo used to post on the abortion debates before he was banned. How interesting that you should get so angry and worked up over such an innocent exchange between me and chloe.  "
sarc,"You would say that, because you are neither a woman, nor gay. Families were ruled by the husband with a clenched iron fist by the way, and women and children had few rights. The family structure was ""secure"" that way. Yes, the fact that there was lower teen pregnancy outside of marriage, is just such a good thing in and of itself. This meant fewer people burning in hell, which is what is really important.emoticonXRolleyes"
sarc,"I actually agree. Make it legal and sign away your rights. However - there are plenty of fathers who opt....... ""Deadbeat Dad"" is practically a profession."
sarc,"A tenth grade education? Why am I not surprised. That explains why you swallow this evo dung, because it makes you feel smart and enlightened. It is the most popular form of intellectual masturbation for the uninformed and pseudo intellectual today; not to mention the religion of the Natural Man. And here's a clue for you buddy, don't believe everything you read on the internet. Try using common sense before swallowing this tripe and if you want to exercise your common sense muscle, go back and reread all of my posts and try to answer all of my questions objectively. You know, those questions that you and every one of your compadres have completely ignored and not attempted to directly answer at all."
sarc,"I am just passing on what I seen personally. I am not trying to prove anything. Just sharing an observation.   PS...from ""our"" point of view? You got a mouse in your pocket? Please explain."
sarc,I have an avatar? And I wasn't born in 1990. Remember what the say about assumptions...
sarc,and you shouldn't forget the thousands of gays incinerated at this death camp!!!
sarc,"Quote Mining. You got to love it. Always fascinating when stuff is dishonestly taken out of context. Normally, we see this from creationists, but you are by no means the first prolifer who has engaged in this practice. But lets look at it"
sarc,"Agreed, and the vehicle they will be riding in will be the Prosperity Express.:)"
sarc,There are certainly more people who think that species evolve from earlier species than there are than people who think species evolve from later species.
sarc,You know what I find amusing here...your entire argument revolves around how it will affect your wallet. Forget about the lives of the people who are denied rights in this country that you take forgranted. That is the true christian-American spirit isn't it? Oh how proud our forefathers would be if they could see us now...oh wait...most of them owned people...nevermind.
sarc,And it seems that the only thing that repulses you is religion. Curious... emoticonXRolleyes
sarc,If that's the case I wish someone would unplug me. I'm getting tired of this version of reality.
sarc,"It's only obvious to the delusional ones, as I did not lift it from anyone. Just stating the truth. If it hurts, tough."
sarc,"Waxy, don't you have better things to do than cruise gay threads. ;)"
sarc,And I didn't have to choose to be homosexual. It is a natural inclination. I chose not to hide or lie about who I am. However you are the one who seems to be under the delusion that being gay is a choice. Once again I ask you if it is just a choice then you choose to be gay this moment.
sarc,"Oh come on. If those words were hateful, then you need to 'investigate' probably millions of people, because those are pretty normal sentiments. Canada must have a LOT of tax dollars. I don't entirely agree with what he said either, but I think it's downright scary that your govt. investigates something like that."
sarc,What is it about the same piece of paper you do not understand?
sarc,"Well, Jews have always been indecisive. Like this joke says:  Q: How many Jews does it take to screw in a light bulb?  A: 4; 1 to screw it in and 3 to argue about which way it turns."
sarc,"Right, what I think doesn't make you naive or delusional, what you think does."
sarc,"Oh, but it does mean something to him. He can't/won't say what, but it sure isn't based on homophobia, no siree! It's just really, really important that marriage stay a striaghts only club, for reasons that can't be explained, but there's no bigotry, don't worry on that score. emoticonXRolleyes"
sarc,You mean the guy who didn't tell his own cabinat he was going to Argentina to go get a little.. and left a power gap because no one knew where he was? You mean that guy?  That is a heck of a lot worse that actually having an affair. Eliot Spitzer at least had the decency to resign when he got caught being a hypocrite.   I personally don't care about his diddling with some woman.. although it does make him a hypocrite since he ran on the 'family values' campaign. It's that little thing about leaving his duties behind without communication that is the real destruction the public trust.
sarc,"Exactly my point! After four pages he finally gets it! Give him a hand! There's a brain in that head after all! But my point is, that unless you do disagree with the stats, your argument is irrelevant.   [QUOTE]What I have been saying for the last three pages is that your question is idiotic, as you're comparing things which are completely different in function. They are not analogous.  "
sarc,"Why is it that people don't want to admit that it was Bush's' reckless spending on a War that we didn't need , the tax cuts for the richest 2 % of America, The Fact that under Bush they had to ADD space on the Debt clock, not to mention that he was as dumb as a rock, yet they can place all this blame on Obama who inherited this mess and has done more to get us out of it than Bush or any Republican would have done. Unemployment is High, we know this, but it was on it's way up when Obama took over because under Bush more corporations left this country , more businesses closed down, the Banks were allowed to do whatever they wanted without regulation of any kind, and yet none of it is his fault?.. Enlighten me..."
sarc,"Somebody needs to check his Little Golden Dictionary. ""Random"" and ""selective"" are antonyms. To say that selection is random is to admit ignorance of the English language."
sarc,"Yeah, lets tax those rich greedy jerks!!! I mean really, why be equal when you want something for free right??? SCREW FREEDOM I WANT MY HEALTHCARE!!!"
sarc,"Well he can defend his tax difficulties by claiming he is a creationist and thus cannot be trusted with quantitative processes involving a bit of mathematics. Then again he can tell IRS that GOD will provide and they should contact Bush to get Gods cell number. I am sure that IRS, GOD, and Hovind can work it all out."
sarc,"But that is a misunderstanding of what the big bang theory is. What it isn't is an explosion. I don't suppose you have actually studied any astrophysics or astronomy upon which you base your rejection of the big bang, have you?"
sarc,He certianly is better educated about things like that than certain evangalic christians.
sarc,"The question is do the dogs want to be protected ? Those poor dogs, for all you know they might prefer death."
sarc,"Two answers: they were either of the ant kind and didn't eat wood until they underwent hyperevolution after the landing of the ark, or they were placed in a suspended state of hibernation by 'Awlmighty Gawd' (only two - one male and one female, in spite of the fact that termites don't actually propagate that way). It is, after all, the word of Gawd, as revealed in the wholly babble."
sarc,"I did not say that I thought that, that would be putting words in my mouth. Sure they'd have access to the report... Sneddon probably had his grubby hands on it ASAP. So what if the investigation was done by private investigators? If Sneddon did it, he would plant evidence... he probably did that when they searched MJ's house. Oops I mean... the government NEVER lies. emoticonXWow"
sarc,"Can you say ""OVER GENERALIZATION""? Can you say ""UNJUST STEREOTYPING""? Can you say ""LIES""? Can you say ""MISINFORMATION""? Can you say ""MUDDYING THE WATERS? Can you say ""JAAAMAN""?"
sarc,Maybe you can talk when you provide us with the actual translation.
sarc,"but you too are a figment of my imagination, and you only think you are a giant alien dreaming about this world because i imagined you as such. you cannot disprove this either."
sarc,"Damn, takes some real gonads (wait, you're a Lib, so scratch THAT one) to claim the power to get inside the minds and hearts of the masses...a protest by Conservatives MUST be racist, but a protest by Libs is pure and righteous, correct?"
sarc,"if you can find an impartial judge, i'll take you up."
sarc,"No, Archangel, if it wasn't done with a gun present any murders committed do not count. In this case, one armed person could have ended the slaughter so quickly it would be incredible but the blood dancers still could have had their day by celebrating that the gun put the children at risk more than the knife murderer and no telling what else they could say to dramatize the situation by claiming that guns were banned there and THAT person broke the law so off with his head...after they harvested his body for useful organs that is."
sarc,My house evolved over millions of years. it built itself . Prove me wrong. emoticonXRolleyes
sarc,"Because all scientists hate god. Again, this is a fact."
sarc,Because the gay personals are full of married straight men looking for discrete gay sex
sarc,"So, do you spend all of your days as an Obama shill? You have two posts, both anti-McCain. I hope Obama pays well. emoticonXRolleyes"
sarc,Yes. So you are indeed committing the genetic fallacy. And apparently unaware of the semantic ambiguity of the sixth commandment. Thanks for clarifying.
sarc,"Proof for a non-event? What century did your purported non-event supposedly occur, Einstein?"
sarc,On the other hand abortion is only opposed by the born and wars are started only bu the born and choices are made etc etc etc etc.
sarc,"Which is why the ""medical establishment"" endorses smoking, drinking heavily and a fatty diet, with no excercise, because they believe we are predestined by our genes, right? Why do you persist with these blatant lies?"
sarc,"Your ""opinion"" was a kindergarten question outlining a ""problem"" that never existed, a ""problem"" that was explained to you 3 or 4 times. How is it our fault that you ask such embarassing questions repeatedly, despite having the answers explained to you repeatedly? How does this reflect poorly on anyone but you?"
sarc,"But yet you have the right to make an an a-s-s out of yourself? As far as the nude beaches go, it would be worth the plane fare if I knew you were going to be at one so I could laugh my a-s-s off.   FROTFLMAO  "
sarc,You said there wasn't a pro-choice group before Roe v Wade. However I would have to do my research to dig up a group in 1850. Hold on...
sarc,I dunno. Those Priuses are so small inside and out. How much explosive compound could Hasan fit into the thing and still be able to get in and drive it?
sarc,"Well, you certainly defended this video, Archangel. How interesting to now hear that you were defending material you hadn't even viewed.   But I'm not going to do your homework for you. It's on this thread; jyoshu posted it. So search his posts on these pages.  "
sarc,And so you have it... Socialist lunatic fringe view that human lives are only worth what the government says its worth....
sarc,This is begging so many darn quesions it's boggling my mind!
sarc,Quite True. I guess those are pretty useless. I suppose His Noodly Appendage works in mysterious ways.  
sarc,###!! You're seriously advocating allowing kids to take guns to school? Don't you have enough greiving parents already without giving kids the option to shoot out a disagreement?
sarc,Those damn black people! All wanting respect and equal opportunity! They should just be happy with what they got!Why should they work for the same pay? They are just selfish! [/end sarcasm]  This argument is tired *yawn*
sarc,"Have you EVER read anything that Dawkins wrote? Any of his books? Now didn't you tell me that I shouldn't be so ""self-confident"" about the Bible because you thought that I hadn't read it? Can you spell hypocrisy? I knew you could."
sarc,"Cheerio and thanks for the examples! Yes these are perfect examples of animals creating ""unnatural"" things- I happen to be thinking of Beavers and their dams but hey, thats just me."
sarc,"Considering what you turkeys did to the State of California, with its budget and social depravity, you have no room to talk. I'm surprised the Lord hasn't cast San Francisco and L.A. into the Pacific Ocean yet."
sarc,"You forget, that all those nice rewards? None of them are rights."
sarc,"The IDEA isn't a bunch of bull, but our implementation of it does leave a lot to be desired. Too bad Jefferson wasn't immortal!!!  "
sarc,"I agree, it is pure genius...especially how it has infiltrated politics and governments. emoticonXBanghead"
sarc,Nothing anyone has said has proven anything I have said wrong in any way because all you have are unprovable and unproven assumptions. Now go over to the other debate Creation versus evolution like a good little boy and you will get my response to Tiktaalik. Nkaaaay?
sarc,"Ah! So wellspoken for an addle-pated twiddle poop! I congratulate you!  And a total lie! Who the Hades wants 13-year-old children to be sexually active? No responsible, thinking person could wish such a thing. You malign Planned Parenthood.  You have ceased to be a credible commentator on this issue."
sarc,I note the bolding but the reason for it is as inscrutable as the peculiar form of what appears to be English which is used.
sarc,Give them a bus schedule or are they too good to ride public transportation? Can they carpool? There's always a solution to temporary transportation problems and it usually doesn't come from Uncle Sam. emoticonXRolleyes   
sarc,You actually have some full insight into gays and what we have gone through and think were pathetic. Once again insults and a bigoted view Archie. You never cease to amaze me.
sarc,"Sounds like a lot of ***Bull*** to me. bah du bup. BTW, Sammy the Bull spelled his name Gravano, not Grevano. emoticonXRolleyes"
sarc,"For one to have evolution as their foundation belief, means that one cannot be certian of anything....."
sarc,"In other words you would wait until we were attacked again before doing what is required. If we vacillate and wait for the nuclear cloud it will be too late. It amazes me; utterly amazes me, at how strongly felt the left believes in the good will of bin Laden and the terrorists to clean up their act. Just amazing. But with Bush? Noooooooo. He's ALWAYS wrong and never right. Isn't that about it?"
sarc,"Yes, but an adult asking such a question is not capable of understanding the answer. ;)"
sarc,"Please be sure to give that message to all the criminals out there. We wouldn't like to have the situation where all the law abiding citizens got rid of their guns and the criminals kept them, would we?"
sarc,The Archbishop of York has a screw loose too on that subject.
sarc,Oh please... You just refuse to acknowledge anything of a victory for LGBT people.
sarc,"Repent, you Christ-denying, gay bashing radical heathen.. well, you already are going to end up in the Pit."
sarc,It's not often you see such a golden opportunity handed to you on a silver platter.  
sarc,V.P.C. once again I am shocked and awed. Why no mention of our fearless atf's  and the agents they caused to be killed. And all the Mexican citizens they have caused to be killed? Oh wait if the vpc did that it would be kinda like jumping outta bed with your partner.  SPECIAL NOTE: Some ATF agents are fearless.  Drug War Victims Drug WarRant  These are a few of the one known about.It works both way's Brady and more our way much more.
sarc,Born again? Pardon me for getting it right the first time. ;)
sarc,You do realize you just disproved your own basic points yes?   The pictures you posted are falsified because abortion clinics and small health clinics contract out to places to have their medical waste incinerated.   Good job on failing to realize you just proved Cunx correct.
sarc,"Wait until Gen. Petraus' report comes out, then you'll eat those words. BTW, do you take ketchup or mustard with that? ;)"
sarc,you always run and hide behind Bryan like the true coward you are
sarc,So now you want to demonstrate that you are also ignorant of the fossil record?
sarc,emoticonXRolleyes Drink Kool-Aid often?   No major party in the US supports the mass murder of an entire race of people.
sarc,So this time you are really serious about leaving emoticonXRolleyes   So now mental existence isn't good enough (as it is not unique which was my point) but human cells is important and something of a human brain. Well what importance are human cells and a human brain? It seems the idea of a human having importance is not just limited to me...you just happen to add another criteria at the end that you feel is important as well.
sarc,"Who is Allah, Alex? Great, I'll take 'things a terrorist god would do' for $1600 Alex.  "
sarc,I didn't think you had either the intellectual or logical ability to respond. :)
sarc,"I wonder if I can convince a judge that all other legal documents should be read in an ""enlightened"" way. I can perhaps get out of contracts and speeding tickets if I just show them the light and error of their ways!   Your supercilious post amazes me."
sarc,"Well actually I have not seen your point of view expressed anywhere but on these forums. Seems to me if its rising to ascendancy at least ONE scientist somewhere would have recently at least mentioned it. Quick search reveals NO mentions at all. Of course if you say its displacing NDS then I guess I will have to agree - you being a well known biologist and all, but I remain perhaps a bit irrationaly skeptical."
sarc,Contribute? Oh please.... Take your crying act somewhere else. Like I said no one is buying your Bull anymore....
sarc,"Yeah, and we all know what happened when they did that with Galileo. emoticonXRolleyes"
sarc,"Ah yes, adopting the Nazi Germany policy of encouraging neighbors to snitch on others, to reward tattle tails for violating the trust of others and invading privacy."
sarc,I'd argue that the woman wants to control who lives or dies. That's scarier to me. emoticonXRolleyes
sarc,"Oh you do love to do the psychological technique known as 'transference' don't you...or is it 'projection'???   You are so obsessed with gay sex, I would not be surprised if you and Ted Haggard have a lot to talk about."
sarc,"Sheesh ! What a way to bring goodwill to all people in the world, ""yearning"" for democracy. And if I remember right Saddam was our toady during the first Reagan Administration. Hmmmmmm, wasn't George Herbert Walker Bu$h our Veep then ?"
sarc,"Don't take it personal EZ, Mental illness is a disease, not something you can do anything about...."
sarc,"So wait, Phunting's good deeds will get he or she a higher position in heaven...but (Phunt, what sex are you?) he or she is going to hell anyway...gotta love Christian logic."
sarc,"About a third of the weapons seized in Mexico were referred to the U.S. for tracing; approximately 11,000 out of 29,000.   About half were successfully traced. Better than 90% of those to U.S. dealers.   Of course your definition of ""minute"" might differ from mine."
sarc,"No, they don't. Creationists do. ""Why haven't all animals turned into humans?"""
sarc,Right. I'm damaged because I'm not a Christian wing-nut. I'm still looking for at least some refutation.
sarc,You your qualifications in logic allow you to judge that? I suspect that you are talking out of your elbow since I haven't seen any evidence that you know what logic is. Mostly I see hysteria and superstition in your posts.
sarc,Flip back to page 9 and do try to keep up.   I am not going to spam the board for the weakest link.
sarc,"On the evidence, that must have been where his brain was located."
sarc,Do try to keep up with yourself. People like you are always talking about how we need gun control laws in response to the crimes taking place. But you have absolutely no answer for what to do when said laws are violated.
sarc,"You are just playing dumb, right? There will be fewer technicians and fewer orders for equipment PER INSURED. Their pay will not be cut. There will be fewer of them PER INSURED. Initially the absolute volume will increase."
sarc,"How remarkable. What a singular idea to invent a contest of skill in which a person in opposition tries to prevent one from outperforming them. Is this the only type of game in which there are two sides, or is this a novelty?  "
sarc,"For being such a ""happy Aussie"", you sure do love to take shots and criticize people. Run out of those happy pills, perhaps? :)"
sarc,"Did you go to college, Trebor? You might want to look up how ""pedophilia"" is spelled. LOL!! Then you can go have a beer with Orion and watch his head swivel."
sarc,"Use some common sense, would you. And while you're at it, trying reading! I said, and you quoted me as saying:  "
sarc,"Gansao, don't be bitter because of what you had to do with a producer, all those years ago, to get your act onto the Gong Show.emoticonXClown"
sarc,Ha! There are a lot more gay owned and straight non-homophobic or non-religious businesses than that. Thanks for the cheap and clueless stereotype though!
sarc,"You know I actually considered that. Too much work, though. I have added to my list of things to do when I retire. That is, of course, assuming that we turned things around by then. If not, I will likely be too busy ""holding the fort"" against the hordes of starving yuppies."
sarc,"So it's alright for a Evo to insult you and go off on a tangent, and expect to get answer. What's the point in answering if your being mocked, before you give answer. Now I know why there are few Creo's on this forum."
sarc,Even Joe the plumber abandoned the garbage scow? Say it aint so!
sarc,"Winning any political election has never been about electing the ""best"" man for the office, it simply means you appeal to the majority of people that showed up to vote. Smartest and most popular aren't necessarily the same person, if you went to school you probably remember that. ;)"
sarc,"VoR is about as Catholic as the Archbishop of Cantebury. I'm curious about what I'm right about though, seeing as I asked you whether you think that medically un-necessary abortions should be legal or not."
sarc,I though the torture was just a result of the number of wing nuts there were around the place.
sarc,"And you can be described as a ""pre-dead corpse"" as well. Histrionic revisionist linguistics only serve to push some form of dishonesty agenda that can not stand by itself on the facts. It is the coward's route. Are you a coward???"
sarc,"Oh, I agree....private security companies are the answer. Very republican of you."
sarc,"So, faith and argument from incredulity.   If you find it impossible please state exactly what part is impossible. Then maybe an actual scientist could take over.  Major in molecular biology? Not even a full degree; not like your going to doing anything original."
sarc,"Ah yes, the Might Makes Right principle. Mob rule. You are so fond of it I have to assume that you assume the mob is always going to agree with you. Poor, naive soul..."
sarc,"First off, your sick. To actually want to see more death and destruction.  Are Americans somehow less intelligent? Your notions are racist for lack of a better term. What to meet stupid? Walk out your front door and sample the people on the side walk. You'll find the same stupid around the world."
sarc,"Even then, your statement does nothing. They aren't ""getting themselves pregnant"". A doctor is doing a medical procedure, that may or may not result in a pregnancy (ya know, those little sperm thingies?) emoticonXAngel"
sarc,Are you just not bright enough to make the connection between:  
sarc,So then the handgun ban did absolutely nothing. Nice to see you could finally admit the truth.
sarc,"Impressive. Misses the point, biggoted, and regionalistic. You've got a whole ignorance trifecta going there! Well done. emoticonXGood"
sarc,"No, no, no. If humans were created 4,000 years ago, then the earth was created 4,000 years and a few days ago. At least try and get it right."
sarc,"You don't see protesters walking around going ""I wanna marry my dog"" or ""beastiality rocks"" do you?!"
sarc,"What part did your real daddy play in it? Will he be on the island, too?  This is a good example of a scant level of maturity. Your simple out for various arguments is to play the idiot/XXXXX card.  More and more each day I see you as a complete waste of oxygen."
sarc,"Well, I suppose creationists would object to careful definition of terms and the assiduous distinguishing of fact from non-fact, wouldn't they? It runs counter to all they hold dear."
sarc,"And, let's see, when did the job loss actually start?   Oh yes.. We can trace the troubles starting in 2007, with a big melt down in August/September of 2008. Let's see.. Obama must have been a terrible president to have caused that.. oh WAIT. That wasn't Obama, that was BUSH.. Excuse Me."
sarc,"You know something is wrong with this world when people attack the act of posting an opinion (that of Ms. King) and another condemns the idea that someone may read it and develop their own opinion. Saving lives is not just a Republican goal. And yes it is an act of desperation. All acts are an act of desperation when it comes to saving the natural process of life with out interference of those who place their comfort above the life inside them.   Whatever is wrong outside the womb, is not the fault of the inhabitant within the womb."
sarc,"So Simone, if the shooter had instead driven his Toyota Prius into a crowd, killing many as a result, would you call for banning Toyota Priuses?"

sarc,"Are you suggesting the pollsters are bias? Nooooooooooo, that couldn't be. You think they were trying to sway the election? Noooooooooo, that couldn't be.

sarc,Well good at least you are aware there is no reason beyond your opinion of morality against gay marriage. So by all means don't marry a man and the problem is solved.
sarc,"Thanks, for giving me the balls. I didn't know you were trying to convert me. So, because I don't believe what you want me to I'm retarded. You know I could say the same about you, it works both ways. You see I don't want to convert you, all I'd like to see is you open your mind to other possibilities. Adios, Arrevideci"
sarc,"Very Interesting! After only 33 posts Mintaka already has the political and gun advocacy priorities of individual members here down pat; or should I say the resurrected antonia, our resident National socialist healthcare freak does and couldn't help but expose her personal insights where none should exist for this alleged newbie."

No country can survive if it allows itself to be undermined. Lincoln went all out to preserve the country, we should do the same things by making liberals illegal.  "
sarc,"Kinda like, ""Don't speak of the speck in your brothers eye when you have a plank in your own?"" :p :p   The scary part of this insane reality is that there are a LOT of whackos that think just like and actually support Pat Robertson.

sarc,"ROTFLMAO. The guy is more like Bush than I realized.   Come on, Easy, if you have never tried pot or XXXX, you are in the minority.   Nobody cares."
sarc,"with tens of millions of gun owners, and hundreds of millions of guns in the US, and you think the guns are still the problem...."
sarc,"Unriggable, your statement should read the so-called ""pro-life"" since they are anything but."
sarc,"And that's why I think you are a troll. There really aren't any experts here. There are several who are knowledgable in a variety of topics, but that knowledge seems to me to be the result of being both educated and widely read. It also indicates an ability to reason and an open mind."
sarc,"Perfect. A creationists caught repeating the same refuted arguments on different forums. Resistance is met, run like a coward to another forum."
sarc,Methinks it's rather obvious that mintaka is JimIrvine because no rational newbie would come here and agree with Irvine's ridiculous and juvenile attacks/assertions out of the box. emoticonXRolleyes
sarc,"A woman's right to choose to keep her legs together is not in any way abridged by this bill. Ho, ho,f***ing ho."
sarc,"how about a Swiss University? they have full automatic weapons in most homes, and target shooting is a national sport."
sarc,"Plenty of examples,law abiding citizens are shot by criminals daily.However the O.P. is about police going off the edge.Oh did I mention that some of those law abiding citizens sometimes shoot the criminal trying to kill them?"
sarc,"Is this another attempt of yours to paint all that believe in smaller, less-intrusive government as loonies? Very transparent, sorry. :("
sarc,"Society highly values the creation of future taxpayers, especially under deficit-spending socialist presidents. :p"
sarc,"You're deluded, as usual. Anything that doesn't balance the budget is based on LIBERAL THINKING. And you don't balance the budget with massive tax hikes and gutting the military like the liberals are fond of doing. And you're going to vote for liberals? Obama? His latest budget plan was defeated 414-0 in the House. Not even his liberal cohorts would vote for it. And you vote for Obama? What the hell is the matter with you people?"
sarc,"Not nearly as tired as the ""YOU can't live like that because it is against MY religion"" argument. Hell, that one pre-dates Christianity!"
sarc,And yet we're still waiting for your mental condition to finally hit you like a ton of bricks.... Denial is the usual reaction...
sarc,"You put such confidence in articles written by partisan plebes, using unsupported, irrelevant links to make the printed text pseudo-intelligent. I cannot imagine you holding your own in a serious debate."
sarc,"Tell us, Steve, now you've been thoroughly snowed (again) by the GOP, how's the weather up there in CloudCuckooLand?"
sarc,"You can believe what you want, your beliefs are not relevant to the issue."
sarc,...but you are just fine with marijuana smoke huh?  I am working on the assumption that you run home to tell mommie or you run to find your teacher and report it immediately. Midgets like you got to have some backup.  How and why do you always change the subject? Can't take the heat? Do you ever read headers?  You got a mouth on you as big as grand canyon.
sarc,I can neither confirm nor deny at this particular juncture that I may or may not be either male or female. :)  
sarc,"Apparently in Marc9000's small, small, small world, if you're not a Christian, you're a atheist.   Thus over 4 billion people are atheists. emoticonXAgree"
sarc,This is great. You mean none of the Davidic line ever copulated with women to produce their descendents? LOL!  
sarc,"You will soon learn, my friend, that fundies have very, very short memories when it comes to refutations of their arguments..."
sarc,  I guess cheer leaders are the new tough guys and gals!
sarc,"That's the difference between liberals and conservatives (AKA ""real Americans.) Conservatives have a sense of humor. Liberals don't."
sarc,Ah the Pinhead element of the tinfoil hat brigade raises its pointy head.
sarc,"I thought that the most commonly accepted date for the alleged birth of Jesus was in 4 B.C. Assuming the current calendar really were keyed on the birth of Christ, how could Christ have been born Before Christ?"
sarc,You mean your hypothetical I presume? Murder violates the rights of the murdered by relieving them of their life. That's why it's illegal.   You're a bit slow I see.
sarc,  How does this address your claim that the Second Amendment served as a defense against a tyrannical federal government? Are you moving the goalposts now?  
sarc,"Of course God would have something to offer to lowely peon, but that doesn't explain what use God has for lowely peons, except for doing stupid pet tricks."
sarc,You and your spiritually-challenged friends are obviously too stupid to understand the difference between a cult and Biblical Christianity.
sarc,so you're one of the many people you got question 1 right emoticonXIdea thank you...thank you. You are the many reasons why the US is still standing on its foundations and not collapsing into senseless ignorance...THANK YOU! :)
sarc,so you think it would be ok to fire people for being secular atheists?
sarc,"Anyone who can read the entire page will find that Zeus is in there, but since you apparently can't read I forgive your ignorance.. emoticonXByeemoticonXBye"
sarc,"Like the crusades and the inquisition? How about the Southern Baptist Convention, formed at the end of the Civil War with the express purpose to discriminate against blacks? And of course, the KKK and the Aryan Brotherhood make the same claims as you. Of course, you're going to tell me that you are a christian and they aren't. But when people tell me they are christians you aren't always around so I just never turn my back on them. That way, even if they are follow that strange pull to make a bad decision, I will at least have my eye on my money."
sarc,Really. Some people would think I'm in cahoots with the creationists. I predict their behavior and then they go and do it.
sarc,And this differs from your cell how? (oh wait it doesn't).  
sarc,"Well, you did... only that ""you"" then resided in countries like France, Brittain, Sweden, Norway, Germany, Ireland, Botswana, China etc, etc ;).... And yes, we where all racists back then..."
sarc,"I typically don't read Antonia's propaganda pieces, so is she holding up the UK as a shining example of dental health? If so, I suggest that she ask a typical Brit to smile, so she can see for herself the folly in such an assertion. The US' ""bubbas"" have better teeth than the average Brit. emoticonXRolleyes"
sarc,"You are like, so totally noble and sensitive! I really admire your pro-humanity stance. That is going out on limb."
sarc,"Just because you don't hold the same beliefs as we do, does not invalidate our belief. I feel sorry for you if all you have to believe in is a small petri dish of algae. You do need absolute proof if your going claim it as the only possible way of creation."
sarc,"LoL What part of a Binding Document, the Constitution with it's Bill of Rights, don't you understand!   You demand that we obey the law, but you would allow Government to break the Supreme law of the Land, and you call me a nut? I gotta say my friend, THAT is truly nutty! emoticonXSmilie"
sarc,Maybe I wanted it from a source that was worth looking at
sarc,"That's nice, but have you ever thought of reading your own religion's Holy Book so that you can intelligently discuss what it is that Jesus and his disciples said?  "
sarc,"Actually no. You read the article again, and thoroughly this time."
sarc,How often to you poke your nose into monkey genitals in order to know that?
sarc,Look who uses profane language; And you claim I'm regressing ! emoticonXChicken emoticonXChicken emoticonXChicken emoticonXChicken emoticonXChicken emoticonXChicken
sarc,Do you have something-other then words from a dusty old book of myth to offer as an explanation?
sarc,"A gay person is a homosexual, friend. He can't change that part about himself. He was wired that way. If you don't like the idea of gay sex, then I'd suggest you not participate in gay sex. That's pretty simple. If you don't want gay marriage, then don't get one."
sarc,"Well if it's so easy then how about you provide the names of the dealers who're selling howitzers and anti-aircraft missiles and fragmentation grenades? And while you're at it, supply the names of the companies who're making them in violation of the various federal restrictions."
sarc,"Well, the French have always been an independent and rebellious lot, not like those staid northern Europeans. And let's remember how much we all owe to those heathens of Greece and Rome!  "
sarc,Like you were raised? Looks like it didn't work and now those hormones must be kicking in? Nothing worse than a menopausal female grinding her ax...their favorite victims? Males.
sarc,"My article say's this. it needs to be noted the alleged evidence for extensive history assumes uniformitarian geology. Because of this fact, this response adds up to: Your theory doesn't work under my theory, so your theory is wrong. Of course you don't want to consider that fact, do you?"
sarc,Not the best school system there although the Mayor has a nice car I hear emoticonXClown
sarc,"Why would anyone want to get to Heaven? Archangel and people like him would be there, praying and chanting 24/7 . Thanks but no thanks!"
sarc,"So, in order to be against gay marriage, a person has to be faithful in his own marriage? Gimme a break. He supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn't get elected. In case you haven't noticed, the majority of Americans are against gay marriage."
sarc,Just as being anti-gun won't compensate for being born with a small brain.
sarc,So how are those gun free zones working out for you?
sarc,It doesn't take a Ph.d. to understand who wrote the first Gospel. Grade school children can look up who was the first man to walk on the moon.
sarc,I see you still don't understand what a strawman is. It is hard to have a strawman when the comment wasn't directed at any particular claim....
sarc,Uhuh! And you've got a bridge in Brooklyn you want to sell me. . . .
sarc,"And I'd hate to let you sneak across your dishonesty, distortions, disingenuous, and unsupported false assertions."
sarc,"hunter, would you be interested in actually discussing this logically? or do you simply wish to toss out empty assertions and run away when challenged? if your view is the truth, then you have no reason to run."
sarc,By your own admission you haven't 'hung out' with stoners for a while and you're making generalisations about them to people who do spend a lot of time with stoners?
sarc,Of course anyone can cite exceptions.....did you see the baby? Probably not.......As long as the mother is OK the baby does not count....... emoticonXRolleyes
sarc,"I don't have to say anything here, your post made it sound sick enough. Yes, freedaom at all cost. Isn't that the theory this country was founded by?"
sarc,"This is odd. You voluntarily participate in a Religion discussion forum - indeed, the frequency of your posting suggests that this participation occupies a substantial portion of your leisure time - but when someone presents you with the opportunity to demonstrate the validity of your position, you 'have better things to do'."
sarc,And so goes the fact you're more than willing to let rapists and murderers go free.
sarc,"Here in Michigan, they closed down the first rest area on I-75 because of the high amount of gay encounters taking place there. Maybe you should poke your head out of your closet once in a while and see what the rest of your community is up to.   "
sarc,Other than the Soldini firearms were purchased legally there is no proof that he had a concealed carry permit. If he had the AP and the rest of the left-tard media (redundancy alert) would still be shouting it from the roof tops. Just because the Brady bunch-VPC says so doesn't make it true. Then what else can we expect from a self confessed torturer of helpless small animals and arsonist?
sarc,"""I don't know; just like I do with everything else, I pretend it's not a problem for my indefensible beliefs."" emoticonXRolleyes"
sarc,But did you consider it relative when you posted this on another thread?:
sarc,"Somehow I seriously doubt that ""Testimonium Flavianum itself"" meant ""from the website by Peter Kirby entitled 'Testimonium Flavianum' that happens to have the text of Josephus' An 20.9.1."" But if that's what you're going with, whatever.   "
sarc,And it remains to be seen if your are. Pick an unreasonable and dumb argument go with it.
sarc,I am still waiting for you to tell me why the gay priests only molested boys.......It has to do with how they are physically contructed.........
sarc,I would argue against this but I would need to introduce subjectivism into the argument. lolemoticonXCensored
sarc,Don't you have that other weird warped forum your posting in now?! Go there with your advice.
sarc,"Hey Dane, you're real good at calling people ignorant, sanctimoniously declaring everything they say as false, blatantly false, or falsehoods. But would it be too much to ask for you to back up your rejection of berts arguments with anything more than insults? Like some actual facts for example?"
sarc,"Then you must have expected him to be a mute on the show. He was basically just there; he made no worthy comments. It was so bad he had to resort to an emotional hypothetical. He made no sense, and that comment had no part in the interview. Bush doesn't send kids to Iraq. First of all they volunteer. Second of all, they are older than 18. Please let me know what comments Michael Moore made that you thought were worthy. You might have trouble.  "
sarc,"Yea I guess you're right, you people tend to blur together after a time."
sarc,"The first Christians were Jews. Anyone who claims to be a Christian but hates Jews is a XXXXX. An anti-Semetic Christian is like an oxymoron term. And an Aryan is supposed to be someone with blue-eyes, brown-hair, and light-skin. You don't have to believe in 'Aryanism' to be Aryan, and the mortal enemies of Aryans are not Jews. 'Aryans' may hate Jews, but most Jews aren't bigoted. By the way, Hitler did not like just Jews but others he considered 'inferior' to the 'superior' 'Aryan race.'   Do some actual research instead of pulling XXXX out of the air to conform to your screwed up opinions."
sarc,"No more of a poison than alcohol (actually far less), should we start lacing that with strychnine?   ***I can see it now***  *Excuse me bartender...what are the drink specials?  -We got Bud Light bottles for $4.00, Jagerbombs for $7.50, and this new drink called Convulsions on the Beach. First one is on the house!"
sarc,"What's Sesame Street?... Oh wait that's where you got your pathetic education isn't it, no wonder you're so ignorant. ... emoticonXChickenemoticonXChicken"
sarc,"Im still waiting to find the text book that will show me how to get perfect order out of nothing explodeing!. What we need is theory to revolve around facts not facts to revolve around theory, other wise all we are ever gonna be are unanchored ships on stormy seas!.."
sarc,"Or maybe they do? Could this sick, perverted individual be the spokesperson for the so called ""gay movement""?"
sarc,"So, then you DO feel that what you did was a sin. Otherwise you wouldn't have asked forgiveness for it.   I have one question. What was your motivation for starting this thread? Was it to try and somehow prove that a person can be a Christian and have an abortion? Just curious. IMO, you are right that you are forgiven for it, as God is a forgiving and loving God. But I hope you don't do it again."
sarc,How about he pulls it out from under the Ramadan tree and unwarps it rather than your Hitler Youth moment?
sarc,"Yeah, they should only teach the sexual positions the Pope would approve of."
sarc,"If by ""We the People"" you mean a handful of self appointed persons with strong financial intrest in the running of the country...   The document is largely a copy of the theories of Montesqieu and John Locke."
sarc,You don't understand words; why the hell was I thinking you'd understand numbers? emoticonXRolleyes
sarc,Not even Answers in Genesis thinks that these ideas have any credence. But Mr. Kent Hovind still does.
sarc,"What part of the Christian worldview? A part of the Christian worldview says stealing is wrong, so you must mean stealing is good? A part of the Christian worldview says rape is wrong, so you must mean rape is good? A part of the Christian worldview says sexual immorality is wrong, so you must mean sexual immorality is good?"
sarc,"No, back to school... turn in what educational credntials you feel you have, and just stay at the coffeehouses... at least you have a .005% of hearing someone ineject some truth in one of those sidewalk tete a' tete's you nutters are so fond of... but here you are dead wrong. Have you ever heard of an egg? ever heard of a sperm? An egg is still considered a multiple cell organism, and a sperm as well. You're gonna have a hard time pulling that one off."
sarc,"The gentleman (??) in question has been presented the facts numerous times. He ""pooh-pooh""s them as irrelevant. He places himself above scientific research. He doesn't know the difference between unsolicitated testimonials and scientific evidence."
sarc,What difference does it make? Do you only care about frequent killings and choose to ignore isolated incidents? If so doesn't that mean that innocent people dying only interests you when it's in large enough numbers that you can try and exploit them for your own selfish agendas?
sarc,"Very impressive how you argue science. Are your arguments science, or are they anger? When Dawkins argues it with his above statement, that Darwinism is as all-encompassing as God is stated to be in the Bible, is it really science, or is it religion?"
sarc,"And once again (s)he rambles on while responding to nothing said in the prior post. At least you're consistent in your irrational hate speech. BTW, the term sword of truth implies no violence against anyone at all. Except in the mind of paranoid hate mongers, that is. emoticonXGood"
sarc,"Man, you are really enriching this debate. We should all sit and listen to your wisdom."
sarc,"Yea, at least on earth you get some relief, you die eventually."
sarc,"Whatever. First you say no one is calling you a hypocrite, than you say people do it, but it just an attack tactic. If you ever get to a mental state where you can entertain the possibility that a critisism of you can be grounded in reality, than go back to my post where I say ""This is why..."" and give it a read again. Maybe you'll learn somethig. Till then..."
sarc,"Come on, Aivlis. Give the guy a break. He's just practicing being a grown person.emoticonXHoho"
sarc,"What I posted lays out the 4 conventions if you will just read it, your questions will be answered. I can't read it for you ya know."
sarc,"In America it's called free speech. If anyone here there, or elsewhere in America doesn't like free speech, and doesn't like a debate forum where the Word of God is found, then they can go whine to their mothers (yo mama)."
sarc,"However, we do give people alcohol, there are many people who drink it on a regular basis who are not addicts. What do these substances you mention have to do with being gay? Would it perhaps be okay for me to have homosexuality on the weekends or after work during happy hour?  "
sarc,It's as much of a point that Phillp Johnson has. Trying to use Philip Johnson as a source about evolution is like trying to use Jack Chick as a source about Catholism.
sarc,"Well, it's not as though you hold your tongue all that often when it serves in support of an anti-gay argument.  "
sarc,And creationism was investigated and explored completely and shown to be false.
sarc,"Except, of course, the evidence is totally against that. Plus, there is the little matter of infant mortality... and lack of resources.   But hey, don't let common sense and evidence stop you."
sarc,"And if there's one thing I can count on, it's your insistence that we can assume guilt and should make a public spectacle of the matter before even investigating any matter.   "
sarc,"If you need a decision made for you, ask me. I'll be glad to. Be prepared to raise your child though."
sarc,That has to be a typo my friend. If you can compress the EB into only 1012 bits then you can write your own ticket in the field of data compression! Lets see 100 million pages into 1012 bits - fantastic - please tell us how. I really would like to put the entire literature of mankind (and more) on an Ipod.
sarc,"Oh relax for cripes sakes. This is the ""fun debates"" forum if you didn't notice."
sarc,"Oh, so this only happens here, huh? Every single hardcore drug addict is here, huh?"

sarc,"And of course, the sea of Montalban's assertions as science, the sea of Montalban's out of context quotes, or the sea of Montalban's misrepresentations of what others have said. It seems that Montalban knows the ""TROOTH"" and won't be discouraged with facts. Sadly, Montalban knows what he believes and reality seems to be irrelevant."
sarc,"So the ""Origin of Species"" has more information for theistic evolutionists than the Bible does?? Does theistic evolution believe in Satan?"
sarc,"Hoo boy! That target just got larger. You still don't get it, do you? Not a ""slave contract,"" but a covenant, a promise :)"
sarc,How do you know if they WANT to believe in a deity? They simply don't.
sarc,"Man cannot invent anything that did not already exist in form. Did we invent the wheel, or discover the idea? Did the Wright brothers invent machine powered flight, or was it that they stumbled upon it? In every culture, in every society, man looks to something greater than himself. They simple don't leave it at themselves and be done with it."
sarc,It's a self-defeating question. You're asking why numbskulls participate in numbskullery.
sarc,Like the crazy idea the Earth goes around the Sun.
sarc,Horse manure. When did you invent that self-serving rule? Put it back in your ditty-bag.
sarc,So what? How long did the idea of magical creation out of nothing in 6 days hold prevelance before somebody actually challenged it scientifically?
sarc,No - but they certainly have a bias. As do we all.

sarc,"Are you blind? I was refering to Nancy Pelosi's ""'fair' speech"" policies, not free speech. Fair speech is an attempt to limit free speech."
sarc,"To the exclusion of all others? I thought you were working for acceptance and inclusion. You are the only one allowed to ""exclude?""   "
sarc,"Ever hear of artificial ensemination? Why is that heteros only think there is one way to produce children? I find hetero sex disturbing,and an unnatural lifestyle choice."
sarc,"Yes none of the organs flown in from Africa or India would be farmed from murdered people, would they?  "
sarc,"Well I suppose I could've always put up a sign that said ""Trespassers will be held with legal counsel, robbers will be shot, survivors will be shot again"" but you're just welcoming trouble with that."

sarc,"No, it's one of those rare instances in which YOU are on the right side of an issue. :p;)"
sarc,And the ability to digest nylon is not a new function?? You seem to have a different conception of 'new function' that what matches with reality.
sarc,My mistake; I read it wrong. And guess what? I do know what the moon is ;)
sarc,"Am I suppose to take that as an insult or just a passing remark,hmmm?"
sarc,"I know. Sad indeed. Orion and his liberal ilk make it a habit to come up with these sophomoric ideas. As if Jesus (who is God according to Scripture) would come out and give Moses the commandments against gay sex and then turn around and incarnate as a gay man. Get real. When the antichrist comes he'll probably be gay (one OT scripture alludes to the antichrist as having no affinity for women, and Satan loves to mimic God's kingdom with some kind of diabolical twist.). Then Orion will prostrate himself before him and receive him as his long lost savior."
sarc,I suspect a good many monitors and keyboards got cleaned on that one? ;)

sarc,by this stupidity a KKK mob with guns is a militia!
sarc,"Did you start the thread in the hope that no one would respond to it ? Is responding to and pointing out the trolling and hypocrisy you have shown wrong ? But I congratulate you for finally admitting that this is a trolls thread. That is more than I expected from you. And as for me reinforcing your contention about conditional christian love ? I do love you my friend, I just hate what you represent which is why I express my love by correcting you and calling you on your every hypocritical contradiction. emoticonXAngel I am Archangel after all. emoticonXGood"
sarc,"Sigma, I was only joking. It hit me this morning though that if I'm willing to talk about abortion without bringing up God, I wonder if the Pro-Choicers could argue their position without bringing up ""women's rights"". ;-)"
sarc,well that won't help you when you go to hell...Woo hoo
sarc,"The judge should be informed that 'the leading' IDist admits that ID is religion. (yes, I've posted this before...) What else could an unembodied designer, which naturalism perforce excludes, be but a deity?

What a great scientific theory! :-)"
sarc,"Ahh, pointy tailed devils with pitchforks, more of your menagerie of divvels, demons, saints, angels, demigods, ghosts and other varied superstitious nonsense. Which of your gods created them, Snerdley?"
sarc,And none of those explanations have anything to do with a magic being who made everything out of nothing. Science should teach currently held theory.
sarc,We gotta GET them law-abiders for having the audacity to believe the Constitution's Bill of Rights! Huh Brady!
sarc,Well so is falling out of a building onto a piece of rebar. Or getting mashed in a car crash. There are a lot more of those than shootings but you don't seem to care. Why is that? Is it because you love to dance in blood?
sarc,"Thats funny, because these scrambled eggs sure don't taste like KFC to me."
sarc,You mean my dog 'CIgarette'??  I took him out for a drag.
sarc,"So, all knowledge is ignorance, and all events not in the present are ignorance. I'm not following you here. How about we leave the definitions as they are, so that we can differentate true from false? Calling everything ignorance doesn't move us forward in the debate. If we accepeted your claim, we are typing ignorance and concuding ignorance, so what would the point be?"
sarc,"Yeah, renaissance right back to the dark ages, that is what you a holes did the last time you were in charge."
sarc,But the official IUPAC name for acetylsalicylic acid is 2-acetyloxybenzoic acid. Duh.

sarc,"Well, she IS getting her info outta the bible, one of the bloodiest snuff novels ever written lol..."
sarc,You mean like a tapeworm? Should removing tapeworms be illegal too?
sarc,"Actually, no one cares if you believe in god. That is your business since it is something that you take on faith without any evidence that it is true. And no one believes in ""evolutin"" [sic]. The theory of evolution is an explanation for observed facts that has been repeatedly tested. It is the best explanation that scientists have been able to formulate. It is based on evidence and not faith."
sarc,"That's quite a leap, even for you. How did you know that the officiers were pro-life? Or that any pro-life people would condone the officiers' behavior in this instance.   I certainly think it was excessive. I guess I must not be pro-life by your illogic."
sarc,"More irrational drivel, and have you forgotten that I am an arab? A smaller minority in this country than blacks? Yet you must play the race card and assume that because I oppose this criminal woman for threatening the life of her unborn child by actually holding her responsible for her own poor conduct that I am somehow a racist. Your argument is as pathetic as your character is found wanting, you immoral apologist for all that is wrong with this country."

sarc,And you're a poor replacement for that koolaid-drinking Seer Travis.
sarc,"and where did they find the participants for this study, bath houses and bars? Gay men are a hidden population in statistical relms. It is very hard to get a true random sample of data on gay men. Studies will say whatever the funder of the study wants it to say. You just get data from the right place. If you want gay men to look like raging alcoholics get your study participants in a bar. If you want them to look like sexaholics then you get your study subjects in bathouses. The truth is that to have honest statistical data you need RANDOM SAMPLES."
sarc,Why? Would you rather get stabbed to death for twenty minutes than get hit in the head with a bullet? A desire to have suffering extended - hmmmm...

sarc,"Wow, make up your mind. Either populations change over time (evolve) or they don't.   Would your wingless beetles be able to produce wings again if they were somehow beneficial again? You are starting to sound like Darwin and his finches."
sarc,Even if winnie the poo could read he simply doesn't have the brain power to comprehend.
sarc,"Yeah, ok, keep up with your ""Creationist"" therory and I'll stick to my much more believable idea of ""Evolution."" Keep your religion out of MY Government!"
sarc,"Good one, Truthsayer emoticonXGood   ...a rich white woman... LOL! Gotta be from Texas. :p"
sarc,They are the people who dont get their boilers serviced regularly:)
sarc,"ok, fine, you can use that line, but there is also a moajority that believes in other things. there's this crazy thing, called a choice. we all have that. remember? i made the choice to have sex, you're making the choice to be a total ***hole. we all make a decision, and its the strong ones that stick with them, even though there are others who dont believe the same thing."
sarc,"I think if that happened, Texas probably will go back to being the lone star state."
sarc,Just another bogus reason for having and abortion............There are thousands of them.........
sarc,"Whatever. emoticonXRolleyes I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill here, but that's up to you."
sarc,"Right, because besides rape and health concerns these really are the only other reasons women have abortions. emoticonXRolleyes"
sarc,Superglue! How you gonna make the DNA?  This is all facinating but it doesn't have a thing to do with information theory.  Copying DnA to do reasearch is a neat trick and quite useful.  Is there a point to this?
sarc,And Sotomayor argued that the American people have absolutely no right to defend themselves. What's your point?
sarc,thats true. i helped. my next bible will be 10 times better if i get around to finishing it
sarc,"Oh, really?   Translation: the only amendments that rise and fall are the ones that I want to."
sarc,Just be like the Jews and Christians and steal the idea! A lot of their mythology isn't original: it was stolen from other people who thought it up first.
sarc,"What a relief, I would hate to think Batman was so gullible. But Dems, I can understand them thinking that. emoticonXHoho"
sarc,And if the majority supported banning Christianity would that be ok just because the majority supports it? Civil rights should not be up for a vote ever no matter what.
sarc,"Anyone can ""give consent"". The issue is wether the parson is old enough to make that decission. I bet the children Michael Jackson raped gave their consent. Does that make it ""allright""? Are the kids ""mature enough"" to take the consequences of those actions?"
sarc,So then I guess you could also debate that algebra serves no purpose as well.
sarc,"Enlighten me. What evidence came out Monday, Tuesday Wednesday, Thursday or Friday of this week?"
sarc,Go ahead and toss your Bible in the trash so you can justify your gay sex sin. See if that gets you into heaven.
sarc,perhaps you would like to explain simplistic.  Is the anthropic principle simplistic?  What natural law created natural law?  Where did the information come from?  Is matter creating matter simplistic? Matter creating information?  Here;s a deep thought:  If matter created the Universe what if it changes it's mind! emoticonXRolleyes
sarc,You mean you don't think you have your own made-up religion?? How interesting! Do you really think you're fooling God? Or us?? Or even yourself??
sarc,"Wow, you are high on Christ...Scary...I haven't seen this addiction up close emoticonXRolleyes"
sarc,"Well I guess then it's open season to call all anti's ""CHRISTONAZI"""
sarc,"Wow, what a group of rude, self important, pompous, pseudo intellectuals who will insult and personally attack a person for one grammatical error. I meant to say the UNIVERSE has aged from 4 to 14 billion years old since I was in school but rather than deduce that you call me dumb and ignorant ? With all of your so called intelligence can you prove the Universe is now precisely 14 billion years old ? Can you prove Neanderthal Man was a human descendant ? because DNA tests dont prove that out and yet PHDs and Masters Degreed scientists insist they are. That's why the bible say's that the wisdom of this World is foolishness to God."
sarc,"Now, that logic is so bad, it's worse than circular reasoning. It's figure eight reasoning."
sarc,"And it will, I guess, take an amendment to deny rights to and make a whole segment of the population second class citizens."
sarc,"Since he's commented on it several times now, and seems to have me confused with someone else, maybe he's channeling a past life or something--who knows? Better yet, who cares? :p"
sarc,"Really? What book is that, because I have seen no quotes or links to any source of any info at all from you anywhere above on this page. So once again accipiter, what in the world are you referring to? You and the obvious child oughta get along fine since you both offer nothing more substantial than personal attacks which are based on your own warped beliefs and corrupted interpretations of that which you disagree with.   Here's my original post again, I challenge you to explain how these alleged stone age sheep herders whom you scoff at and mock described contemporary living creatures which paleontologists today identify as dinosaurs, from skeletal remains?"
sarc,"If they haven't been discovered yet, HOW THE BLOODY HELL DO YOU KNOW?  Ten percent more brains and you'd be pondlife. emoticonXKill"
sarc,whooooosh. emoticonXBye  That was the sound of my point as it went over your head.  How much do you want to but I don't find any?  Go ahead bet me! Are you afraid?
sarc,Well that's a stupid statement. Stupid enough that I can't even wrap my head around it and make a proper comparison.
sarc,"Oh, but Sina does not live in a womb so she is unimportant."
sarc,Somewhere in the middle? I always though it was solidly to the Right. :p   
sarc,"An immaculately presented response, entirely avoiding the topic, or indeed reason, in order to unwittingly further the case for retrospective abortion."
sarc,"Explain that one to the thread starter. He claims he is the victim of age discrimination when he states ""I am a person 15 years of age and I want my gun, yet I can't get one. Why not?"""
sarc,And how do you know what other animals can analyze? Is that another supreme abilities of us humans? To read the minds of animals?
sarc,"Depends on how basic they are. Not much call for using flint, steel and tinder to start fires."
sarc,"Dont mind him, hes just sticking up for his new boyfriendemoticonXLove"
sarc,"And I'm sure you of all people know the mind of God... Please, you just take snippets of scripture, and twist it into well this is absolute. God loves gays and lesbians, but you fling god out as a way to justify your slander and bigotry.   "
sarc,"Well then. All of the ex-christians have it both ways don't they. Since they are saved they can lie, cheat, steal and have wild, illicit sex (following the example of several christian preachers)."
sarc,"I dont need a sex lesson from a little boy.  Once again you missed the point( getting to be a habit).  We are talking about behaviour that was condemned by the preacher, one of which was adultery..not fornicating but I am sure the preacher would condemn that too  If you read the link you would know.  If homosexuality is condemned by god then they cannot marry in gods eyes..keeping up?  If gays cannot marry then gay sex must be outside of marriage therefore it is fornicating.  You really should try to use your little head more.  'Lets stay on topic' who made you a mod?emoticonXChicken"
sarc,"There are somewhere between 10 and 20 million gay people is America. 10,000 is a small minority, yes. And even your article admits this number is unsubstantiated, AA. More lying for JESUS."
sarc,"Yes, because Republicans are the only hypocrites in the government, right? emoticonXRolleyes"
sarc,Here we go again with the name calling..............See what I mean Justine.......no wonder the gay movement is losing traction in this country........
sarc,Anything that doesn't fit your preconcieved prejudices is automaticlly wrong?
sarc,"Considering what the TOE says, if a dolphin ever gave birth to a chipmunk, it would disprove evolution."
sarc,"So in your own words the police want to go on murder sprees, because they're armed. According to you the military is just waiting for the first convenient excuse to open fire on anyone, be them designated enemies or just innocent bystanders."
sarc,"You're a Bush-man, aren't you, gnojek? Come on, admit it. With that stance, you'll be in the White House before sunrise.  (You do realize that I was being sarcastic - right?) emoticonXRolleyes"
sarc,"Yes, that was one of Galileo's more absurd leaps of logic."
sarc,"Yeah, so if on my math test, I put ""The answer is 7 because my god says so"" and the teacher marks it wrong, he's the XXXXX?"
sarc,Let's allow same-sex marriage only. Then heterosexuals will have the same right to marry someone of the same sex.   
sarc,Being put in a cell with Howard Dean for life? emoticonXCry
sarc,"Good point. If she is old enough to be licenced to drive, presumably. If she travels by bus, train or plane, are those companies complicit?"
sarc,Your own source said the amendments are 11-27. Amazing how the 2A got incorporated into the XIV isn't it without Article V. emoticonXGood
sarc,That could also be very effective in a positive manner during political campaign speeches.
sarc,"You really think so? Im flattered, but I think you are wrong."
sarc,Umm I dunno that whole faith thing is kind of important. Oh I get it you were being insulting.... Gotcha.... BTW hows that whole spiritual enlightenment thing working out for you?  
sarc,Good point. emoticonXAgreeemoticonXAgree The poor guy would be like a midget that got his stepladder taken from him!
sarc,"You apparently know as much about law as you do about science. You wouldn't be arrested for having someone willingly consume a plant unless that plant was a controlled substance and last time I checked, poppy and weed weren't cancer cures."
sarc,Says the one who uses the abortion card when he's about to lose a death penalty thread.   
sarc,"the same way most people on planet earth dont give a XXXX about american ""football""  "
sarc,"I get the feeling they have filed under: Plague, Avoid like the."
sarc,"Translation: Muslims are worth nothing. Christianity is superior, therefore they are worth nothing. Let the US come in and kill them, ruin their cities, and take their oil."
sarc,"Right, expect when talking about the 14th amendment. The way you guys like to define ""equal protection"" would make it so any restriction is unequal."
sarc,"Here come the Christians, thinking they can know everything by guessing, and commiting the genetic fallacy left and right."
sarc,"So the fact that we still have criminals who choose to kill others, should be used against is in determining whether we can be trusted or not?"
sarc,I don't think it's a cover-up. I think that it's a conspiracy between the black helicopters and the aliens beaming suggestions to those without the foil-lined hats on. :)
sarc,Please emoticonXRolleyes Why dont YOU post something thats not one sided and full of non factual evidence that isn't full of spin and your crazy agendas?
sarc,"In that case a man in a coma is not a person then, is he?"
sarc,"Ah?""scratching head""I just woke up,what?womens choice,her body,death penalty?ah ok gotch ya.emoticonXFrazzled"
sarc,"Obviously, in the event of a disaster, George W. Bush sure thinks he has a right to choose.  Hmmm, let's see, should I interrupt my vacation just because people are drowning in New Orleans? Naw, I don't think I should. They're just poor people and they probably didn't vote for me."
sarc,"Plain with the benefit of hindsight. I love how you're able to determine, not having been there, precisely what was said and precisely where it fell in relation to the law. If it was so clear, we'll see the prosecution for wrongful arrest in due course, I'm sure."
sarc,And yet it's usually the liberal democrats who are in favor of murdering innocent children...
sarc,"Does your use of the past tense ""was"" imply that you've seen a burning bush and been converted to reality? Or are you still an ""anti-american pinko commie bleeding heart liberal?"""
sarc,"You have no Idea how glad I was that I was sitting down when I read this!!  First it shocks me that you haven't labeled all those who claim to see UFO's liberals.  Then I have to wonder didn't at one time the RCC say we were the center of the universe,... The sun went around the earth,... the earth was flat ?? Theres no one but us .. It was all created for us??  Ok I'm goning to go take a little breath of fresh air and rest for a moment as this is very disturbing to me! .... V.O.R. and I agree on something. I think I'm going to be sick!! Back in a few."
sarc,"Simone, read the sentence again please. It was ""Saving lives is ""not just"" a Republican goal."" It concerns the subject of abortion.   The only way it relates to the politics of Iraq, is that abortionist would rather kill our kids before they get to ""volunteer"" their services for Iraq.   I can't let one statement you made go though. Terrorist continue to terrorize us? Where have they attacked in the U.S. since 9-11? Consider continuing this in an appropriate thread."
sarc,"Thankyou for bringing to my attention that atoms, neutrons and protons are merely scientific assumptions. Now as I gaze at the night sky with all its' bits and pieces spinning around each other I can sleep happily knowing that our solar system is not part of a housebrick afterall."
sarc,"What makes you think I don't. Yours is not the only religion on earth!! And I didn't just jump to the concluision that your soul needed concern, so don't jump to it with me."
sarc,"It was a troll. Now that we've activated email response, it could take another look or expand some mail list."
sarc,"As usual, you shoot from the lip. I have no illusion of perfection, However I am convinced that as long as you live I will never be the dumbest man on earth.   "
sarc,And yet the post-Dunblane handgun ban happened after only one event.
sarc,"Like evolution, right? You have your conclusion, so everything else must adhere to it. Just answer the question. How to you account for the statements above?"
sarc,"Just helping something live doesn't affect evolution unless it affects the ability to reproduce viable offspring.   If there was no nylon before the 1940s and there is an organism that can survive by eating NOTHING else, what does that tell you? There could not have been a population of nylon-eating bacteria before 1940. This is a new population that did not exist before."
sarc,"Nah, he has been TRAINED to recognize demonic possession as part of his B.A."
sarc,I think jyoshu has posted a BS meter which is pretty nice.
sarc,"What's your point? Unicorns breathe toxic gas and have low density, so they can get around all they want."
sarc,I want to know how giving her abusers more reason to abuse her makes sense too.  
sarc,"Don't forget cheaper to feed, take orders better, and are harder to hit."
sarc,"Wow, so Balrogs existed according to the Bible? Whoda thunk."
sarc,"Oh yes, Mr Behe makes a comfortable living out of selling to the ignorant. His newest book is just a rehash of his old book, and has the very same flaws that have been destroyed over and over again. As for your 'religious authors' being respected.. they are respected perhaps by the fundamentalists that do not understand what science is about."
sarc,"You bet. Got a Scriptural problem with that, 'O ""jesus""? Or are you not familiar with your own inspired Word?"
sarc,"I guess the Sinagua ruins and the Kayenta, Anasazi Wukoki ruins in Arizona just don't stack up against them big old Jewish buildings."
sarc,"Oh it applies, but if we were to look at the Bible that way, God wouldn't allow one single bad thing to happen."
sarc,That's an out that's peculiar to Christians. Good? Godidit. Bad? Devil's work.
sarc,"Oh, dear. I seem to have lost you again. 'Peer' just means a group of people holding the same biases."
sarc,because you wanna be wrong all the time...that seems like a good reason :)
sarc,"Because of massive cultural differences. You might as well be asking ""if both Americans and British people speak basic english, why do British people refer to apartments as flats?"""
sarc,"Possibly, I must admit I never tried to gain access to swords whilst over there."
sarc,Isn't that exactly what I said! Clearly we have an issue of a probably overweight white man who is without a doubt racist (because if we know anything it is that every white male that has short hair is a racist) coming down on a black woman!   You nailed it again MA! Props to you for uncovering this mystery.
sarc,I know I know. Unless a woman is gestating or dieing she is being selfish.
sarc,"Then by that standard, christianity is horse puckey! Christians contradict each other. Oh! But wait. Anyone who disagrees with you isn't ""really"" a christian."
sarc,"Gee, I wonder why the liberal left is so quiet? I remember when Bush's DWI from decades previously came out, and you couldn't shut the hypocrites up!   It's hilarious."
sarc,"Or, since he didn't have $37-million tucked away from questionable business practices and a rich daddy, perhaps he paid attention to the ramifications of abnormal deficit spending."
sarc,"Uncle Sam hasn't tried to pass a law saying people can't install left-handed doornobs, to supposedly protect the doornobs of right-handed people. I guess right-handed people don't feel threatened by the minority. What a concept!"
sarc,"Anyone speaking English could well be an illegal from the UK then, right?   I guess Puerto Ricans better watch out too."
sarc,Are you really so dim that you think me answering a question you POSTED is somehow any implication at all on thelmoose's intelligence? emoticonXRolleyes
sarc,Na. Probably from smokin the Bovine Excrement they are trying to pedal! emoticonXSmilie
sarc,"lol...you read my whole post only to conclude with ""what's your point."" Evolutionist brilliance on display. I'm not mistaking nothing for nothing. I know my stuff. You obviously know nothing and don't care to learn it."
sarc,Have you lost your mind? I got no idea what you are talking about.
sarc,"Your signal to noise ratio was too low for my tastes: too much ""wackiness"" (I assume ""wackiness"" was what you were trying for) and irrelevant side discussions."
sarc,"Have some cheese with your whine, turkey?  Who is the liar? It is the person who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a person is an antichrist. 1 John 2:22  That would be you and those like you. Repent, you heathen!"
sarc,Let's establish a campaign to search for the hypocrisy of people who call themselves pro-life yet find nothing wrong with killing a grown human being.

sarc,I wasn't aware that a hairstyle could choose to believe (or not believe) in a god.............
sarc,"Look at Dunblane. Then look at Columbine. Who had the higher death toll?  How often do school shootings take place in Germany?  When was the last time somebody went driving and shooting in a killing spree in America?  Name the last mass public killing in America, in a public place where the number of victims reached double digit territory.  Go on Brady, we're waiting for you to prove that you actually have a point. Don't disappoint us."
sarc,"And the Brady background check has not been repealed either so by your ""logic"" it must be effective."
sarc,"Leave it to a leftist to cite a leftist forum for evidence that a leftist agenda is supported by dedicated leftists. Go figure, huh? This post just proves that attempting to reason with such an irrational thinker is truly a waste of time and effort."
sarc,"It appears that peddler is finally open to learning new things! (Unless, of course, peddler is simply being facetious... which is not obvious from the immediate context.)"
sarc,Do you know how many Osama Bin Ladens we Killed???? emoticonXRolleyes
sarc,"<flush>  Just come up with something that discredits the resurrection, if you think you can. Should be easy for you Einsteins, shouldn't it?  But in two years I haven't seen it yet. Not from you or anybody else.  Where's the beef?"

sarc,"Congratulations, Hunter. You have just accepted the 5 primary tenets of fundamentalism. So I guess that makes you a fundamentalist.  "
sarc,"Sweetie, if every gay person were as wealthy as Mary Cheney, we could laugh all the way to the bank and ignore the prejudice in society the way she does. Indeed, we'd probably be the darlings of the GOP. Unfortunately for your delusion, gays are no more or less wealthy on average than anyone else."
sarc,"That post is not only off topic, but yet a further example of your being completely out of touch with reality."
sarc,I think you need to breathe in a bag for a while..then maybe have a nap.
sarc,"Please do, because according to your source McVeigh called himself an Agnostic.  "
sarc,"You're equating atheism and homosexuality with terrorism and drug dealing? Really? Can you stop being a reactionary dolt long enough to convince me you're worth even trying to converse with? If not, I'll understand... and not be surprised."
sarc,"Cower in fear of your god Easy, I'm not afraid, and nothing that you say is going to make me fear things which I believe to be imaginary.   Thankfully, our nation does not make laws based on your Phelpsian beliefs that god punishes the masses for the sins of others."
sarc,Sorry baby the story was in the religion of peace land. Your strawman is burning.
sarc,Is that right next to ANWR? Are the Canadians downplaying ANWR while they side drill to extract our precious fluids? emoticonXClown
sarc,A truly charming publication. Over flowing with the warmth of human goodness.

sarc,So? What does that prove? That Cheney's draft number was called more often than Slick's? emoticonXConfused
sarc,Senior citizen yachties stand little chance of defending themselves against pirates.   Piracy needs to be dealt with using military might.

sarc,"I guess I'd rather live among them, too, than have a hot poker shoved up my bottom."
sarc,Did you notice how what I was responding to was said? I didn't think so. Your tunnel vision is showing again.   
sarc,"You mus think you're pretty smart huh? Well guess what? You're confusing common, most common, majority, and norm. Lefthandedness is considerd common and the norm. You're using a superstistion from 300 years ago to qualify left handedness as deviant. Good try though.  Also left handed is genetic. It's not a gene but it's genetically related to the person's physical characteristics."
sarc,"No. What the doctor was doing was going to church. He was not a monster. He was not a ""sicko."" He was a murder victim.   What his murderer did was murder."
sarc,"Yes, we shouldn't let those slaves be citizens, they will burden our legal system since they will now have...OMG...rights!"

sarc,"Well then, you would immediately notice a 15% reduction in bullying! Rejoice!   "
sarc,"That does not surprise me. A whole world filled with people who look, speak, think, and do things different than you must be absolutely terrifying.  "

sarc,"Yep, Martha is in trouble and the democrats are panicking.   I think the strong Independent support for her opponent is due to Martha's own lack of appeal.

sarc,"Well, then, I guess that in America we can't possibly be safe from kill-happy gunners can we?"

sarc,Wow ehat a brave new world you live in.... Now lets say just 1% of all gun owners resisted (in the us that is several hundred thousand peppered through the land). With media attention to such infighting between government and citizens how do you deal with this?
sarc,"Here's some advice, if you're going to try and crack on me, make your 'jokes' (I'll be nice and call them that) less passive and more active, grammar-wise.   Crim-   A definition is the meaning of word that someone created using their own opinions. Is there a difference?   And, a circle could be called a circle in the English language, but I could make up a new language in which a circle would be called a square and a square a circle."
sarc,"So you advocate religion not because it is the truth, but instead because it gives you comfort and security? The opiate of the masses eh?"
sarc,"First off, kudos on getting the quotes right! It's much appreciated.  Now, what's your actual assertion? If you spell it out than we can put this definition debate in context, and maybe actually get somewhere."
sarc,"ER, you're doing the God complex again. Sandra Fluke might not even use birth control because she may very well be celibate. Only God ... and ER who thinks he's God ... know."
sarc,I just bet you thought you were smart just now? I'll go you several...   How about:  1. Murder  2. Stealing  3. Adultery  4. Rape  Almost every culture since the dawn of civilization has put to death those who have trespassed those basics. But I guess you didn't get that on the Recovery Channel huh? Your idiocy is profound only as your ignorance.
sarc,Did your mummy read you scary stories when you were littler?
sarc,"Oh, gee! There goes my irony meter. It pegged and started smoking at the end of the first sentence. Archy is just being christian by trying to impose his twisted morality on everyone."
sarc,Before you were claiming it was a slippery slope. Now you're claiming it's a strawman. Perhaps you don't understand what either term means.
sarc,"But rather than be honest about your mistake, you just changed things without paying any attention to the fact that we've shown you have no idea what you're talking about when it comes to the claims of the scientific community.. at least, not until somebody tells you.

sarc,"Tell me genius, how is me accurately and correctly pointing out your mistake colluding to misdirect anyone? Either you are again using words you don't know the meaning of to make such an inaccurate statement, or you're just lying. So which is it penfold, are you ignorant or just being dishonest again? emoticonXConfused"
sarc,Talk about a crock! How can you wail on anyone with your imaginary truth stick of no mercy when you wouldn't know the truth if you tripped over it? And you going ballistic like this just proves the exact point I made in that you'll allow my free speech until I say something you disagree with and then you attack me to shut me up. Which is exactly what I said above that precipitated your childish tirade. See?
sarc,Michael Moore Hates America is also coming out in theaters some time in October.

sarc,I noticed that you do reply to mine. Perhaps you should reconsider since you're getting your ar$e handed to you with every reply I write. ;)
sarc,"So, once again, the lack of criminal prosecution isn't due to the red herring that you claim, but rather the incompetence of the Justice Department. Franken's bill doesn't have a provision for making the Justice Department do its job, does it?"

sarc,"Strange, I thought it was supposed to be a global flood that wiped out all of man except the chosen few. That would be 'involving Australia' one assumes."
sarc,"So it doesn't matter that someone dies in their forties from hunger and cold because they are homeless and penniless, whilst another lives in luxury with the best food and medicines until his 80s: they are both equal? What planet do you live on, for it sure aren't the real world..."
sarc,You mean that the planets and stars have always existed? Really - so how come we see stars being made in nurseries via the Hubble telescope.
sarc,And I'm guessing by your misinformed posts that you have not been high before. Did you recently watch a film called Reefer Madness by any chance?
sarc,Is this satire? If so...bravo...well done. emoticonXGood If you are really serious...ummmm...excuse me. emoticonXEmbarrassed
sarc,"Not to speak for Jim, but I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess it was ""Rebuttlickan"". Just a hunch."
sarc,"On the bright side, it appears that the Rapture will solve the Social Security financing problem..."
sarc,"So somebody try and tell us, that with stuff like this going on, that America still needs to overhaul its gun laws to bring them more in line with those of Mexico."
sarc,"Ah, so I don't like democracy, and yet it is you who in the post are telling me that I have to support McCain's statement. Are you serious? That sure doesn't sound like democracy to me. I also find it funny that you claim that I don't like democracy when my very post stated that I would be voting for the Democrat party. But then, I guess if we don't support Bushyboy and his fellow republicanazis, we must be against democracy, right? Get real, Phyllis."
sarc,Not in the mood? Oh I see because they restrict you already your not in the mood to remove the regulations that do not work and insert proper ones that do. Excellent ignore the issue at hand and give no suggestion to improve upon the current laws and restrictions....  
sarc,Really??? Maybe you should do a little research before you make sweeping statements like that. -- http://www.rainbowbaptists.org/
sarc,"Once one is adept at finding evidence after a conclusion is presumed, all sorts of ""proofs"" reveal themselves. What's next, Nostradamus?"
sarc,"In my lifetime, we've made huge strides, but there's a lot more to learn."
sarc,And why would you say something like this? Because Christianity prohibits it? I can't think of any other reason.
sarc,"It's a real mess, though you've to got to give them points for originality."
sarc,60% accepting Roe v Wade is a high figure don't you think? More people support abortion then the president.
sarc,Do you need faith to know the sun will rise tomorrow or that 2 + 2 = 4 or to know that if you drop a rock it will fall to the ground?
sarc,"I'm not big on the abortion issue, but are you saying that anyone who disagrees with you is sexist and arrogant? That's a tactic straight from the leftist playbook. Clearly you're the one who's arrogant, if you can make these kinds of baseless generalizations of your opponents. Isn't it you who always accuses conservatives of being intolerant of people who think differently than them? Now that's irony!"
sarc,"I'm sure it is many a doctors' spiritual duty to relieve suffering, just as Jesus healed the sick.   Besides, who wants to go back to 40 year average lifespan, like they have in Afghanistan? Not me."
sarc,"If the rejecting of the ""lifestyle"" results in death, beatings, job displacement, eviction, insults or inequality, then what would YOU call it? ""Religious moral code?"""
sarc,"Waxy, please read this. Maybe it will help you. When you said the proper way to say it was, ""....tell me I'm wrong, at least do it grammatically."" you made absolutely no sense. Do something grammatically? You obviously have to use grammar when you write a sentence."
sarc,"Ah, so we shouldn't get all stirred up because little girls are singled out for slaughter?  Please excuse me for having misplaced priorities."
sarc,"Sorry did I say pacifist?I meant yellow bellied pacifist.However if its any consolation, I meant anti's in general not just you Sinj.sorry if it sounded that way."
sarc,"So, some parts of the Bible are erroneous oral history after all! What a refreshing admission."
sarc,Are you serious? Man I thought you actually had a brain in that dense hollow cranium of yours. You do realize there are Straight Atheists and GAY Christians right Gans?
sarc,"You can start your own thread on how historical the Gospel accounts, etc., are.   How about dealing with the question now instead of running scared and going down another rabbit trail?"
sarc,"If it did that, then you might have won an argument by now."
sarc,"The point being that nobody is spoiling Christmas for the children, you paranoid fruit cake."
sarc,"While I fully realize you can't do math and thus why you consider it atheism, but post #96 and post #81 are not the same post. But then again, you were the one who argued that post 113 came before 106 so maybe you do think that complete failure to understand math and linear thinking is sane?   "
sarc,"Demolishing your ""rebuttal"" in post #14 does, however. You missed it."
sarc,"Maybe because it's a loaded question? If another evolution hoax were discovered similar to Piltdown man, would you reject evolution and become a Christian? :p"
sarc,"You are the only one in this discussion that shows a predominant lack of logic or reason. Your position has been proven wrong, get over it ."
sarc,"What about them? Is this a question?   Um. Have you read Leveticus? And I mean, read it. Not skimmed it.   Because, God loves everybody. Are you reaching?   And what does fast and loose mean? I'm confused. I think you are trying to label me.. but I'm not quite sure what I'm being labled as.   What part about people burning in hell for eternity?"
sarc,Symbiote seems to have had a large hair across his butt.
sarc,"Because of your question "" What is your definition of pure"", I now know how to make soap. I'll never stink again!!! And I think homeopathic medicine is all about using things like vitamin c to prevent colds, and making sure you ingest lots of calcium if you are worried about ostioperosis. Ya know stuff that makes sense."
sarc,Is it possible to be an adult and be as clueless as you seem to be?  This was in response to the question did Jesus not believe in evolution.  Only someone with similar mental capacity to yours would ask such a question.  It seems unfair I have to answer this senseless comment you added to the nonsense.
sarc,"We are figments of our own imaginations, sent here by Satan to annoy the faithful! emoticonXAngel"
sarc,"Well, in the case of a creationist, the bias determines what evidence will be discarded, what evidence will be twisted, what evidence will simply be ignored."
sarc,"ah yes.....""Gaytheist,"" the terminal homosexual atheist liar at various forums such as IIDB and Tweb misrepresents me to some guy who studies tadpoles. The little XXXX liar atheist claimed to the author that I used his paper as ""evidence"" of lamarckism -- which was a bold-face lie that she couldn't back up when I pressed her on it. This was merely his response to her strawman lie. Funny how you must repeat these lies to help cover up how pathetic your theory is."
sarc,"What's your evidence that the Gospel prophecies are ""spurious claims""? Seems like you've bought into a scalding case of rational tunnel-vision (or political correctness, if you prefer)."
sarc,"That explains your excellent use of grammar, word choice and spelling? ROTFLMAO"
sarc,Aw shucks! And I reckon in Kansas they won't ever care whether or not you learn how to spell ATHEIST.
sarc,"BOY-HOWDY!! Why don't you let me know how you really feel? I have not tried to demonize anything. Rap music does that to itself without any help from me. Rap is the lowest form of music that I have ever heard. It is just too primative for my tastes. Once again, I am not a racist, nor am I sexist. I do my own washing. I wish you and your child nothing but the best in life. Some folks think that exposing young children to Rap music is a form of child abuse, I agree with those folks.  P.S. Tell that Southern girl to find another room-mate, you sound like a horrible role model. Well, got to go wash some more underwear."
sarc,That's because the Taliban in Afghanistan didn't have any oil with which to bribe them.
sarc,":p I wish! If I did, I'd be as wealthy as the Church, who does. emoticonXHoho"
sarc,Make up your mind. Is it because of diet or is it because of evolution. It would be nice if you pick a horse and ride it.
sarc,I'm now slightly less confused about why I've never seen this discussed before.
sarc,"Never thought of that. If that ""person"" has rights, do they have responsibilities? Could a fetus be charged for causing toxemia? How about suing the little tyke for giving mom varicose veins and stretch marks?"
sarc,Yea right you are likely to know. Stick with the enema hotline.
sarc,"So, you're just an anti-geologist, anti-cosmologist, anti-archaeologist, anti-physicist, and probably a few more that I can't be arsed to think of right now. *shrugs* Might as well get it over with and just say you're an anti-science religious nutter."
sarc,"Just like it's the job of the gun control lobby to try and pass an overwhelming, unreasonable level of fear of an inanimate object?"
sarc,"Talk about incoherent wishful thinking. Instead of unsubstantiated claims and baseless attacks, why don't you provide, oh, I don't know, mybe some peer-reviewed EVIDENCE? You know, that little old thing that is required for anyone to take your wild claims even remotely seriously?"
sarc,"I like the Grape Flavored best, But I won't be drinking any KoolAid with you or one of your religious Cult Fanatics...   And why would I be embarrassed about telling the truth?...."
sarc,"Well, if history were binding we would still have slavery...and abortions being illegal for that matter. Something being done for a long time doesn't mean it makes it in the constitution. I don't know which part of the constitution has a ""preserve history"" clause.  "
sarc,"Oh yeah right, like sociopaths who are bent on killing and slaughtering everyone around them, can be fixed with something as stupid as school counseling."
sarc,I guess it is a bad thing to make his wife cry but the republicans can make any hatefilled statement of attack against gay and lesbian americans and that is ok.
sarc,Why don't you answer Bryan's post above troll? He has some important information you would never figure out by yourself?
sarc,"What! You mean that WE don't want to do all of those things? Who knew? I didn't get the memo? emoticonXConfused   And you forgot ""make Seniors eat dog food"". emoticonXGood"
sarc,This coming from the guy who is accurate on every thread on this forum and provides factual and analytical evidence to a intellectual arguement. (sarcasim) PleaseemoticonXRolleyes
sarc,"So what are you claiming now? That all this time that Rosie was making fun of the Chinese, she's actually been Chinese all the while? Because that's the only legitimate way you could draw a parallel with those people who are hypocritically attacking gays while being gay themselves."
sarc,"Well, if you combined his plan with all the others, then make all the cuts at once, you would be like 25% of the way there!!   Come on, Steeeve...we have limited material to work with here....."
sarc,"I can hear all the scores of laughter now. emoticonXRolleyes emoticonXRolleyes emoticonXRolleyes   But alas, this is pointless, as are you. I'm bored and done.   ciao"
sarc,"That ""brilliant"" statement has absolutely NOTHING to do with the original point.   ...later"
sarc,"Why not? My mother has been 39,for the last 39 years."
sarc,"Since you're so fond of reporting personal attacks to the mod, maybe someone should return the favor to you? emoticonXRolleyes"
sarc,"Apparently Archie thinks this is golf, where the lowest score wins. Who wants to clue him in?"
sarc,"Are you trying to be funny in a ""I'm the one who drew attention to this aspect in the first place, but now I'm going to criticize you for talking about what I drew attention to"" type mentality?  "
sarc,"Um, Bassman, so you, the one person in the world who is as ""pure as the wind-driven snow,"" is the one who may judge others, including Democrats. Um, for the record I grew up on the prairie and saw a goodly bit of ""wind-driven snow"" and it was not particularly pure. A feeble and laughable metaphor."
sarc,"If only Ann Coulter could report a pie throwing to the admin like a spoiled little cry baby. emoticonXRolleyes   She's probably more of a ""man"" than that though. :p   Waxy"
sarc,Somehow I think most people are going to be a lot more comfortable with their kids seeing people in African atire with long hair than with scantily-dressed (or topless) people simulating sex acts. emoticonXRolleyes   
sarc,"Balloon Juice Blog Archive BoBo Brooks, New King of the Media Village Courtiers?"
sarc,You mean like Korea? Oh wait we are still there....  Is Israel a nice secure place safe from terrorism? The notion that Iraq will be without conflict will not occur in our life time.
sarc,"Confucius, that is one of the biggest puddles of sentimental puppy dribble that has ever been manufactured."
sarc,"I get what you are trying to do but it doesn't work. You might as well say ""let's print a bunch of money...pay off the debts...and then force people to burn it!""."
sarc,"Only in your mind could lying about me be telling the truth smiley. And if you had any concept of what truth is, you wouldn't be an anti-christian atheist my spiritually blind friend. emoticonXAngel"
sarc,"I think pedophilia is a disorder as opposed to an illness but I'd have to look back at some psychology books. How do I define illness? Well, I have a few contexts for this. The flu...obvious illness. Christians feel that sin is an ""illness"", so in that sense we are all rather ill :). As for wrong...same deal.  "
sarc,"Now you're just being an butt. The word Dungarees is a coloquialism. Do you know what that word means?   Also that's what jeans were called before the word ""jeans' entered the venacular. (Do you know what that word means?)   So, now are you going to tell me that only homosexuals have larger vocabularies?   Get a life...and preferably not mine...I'm living it at the moment."
sarc,"Odd. I can't seem to find any racial slurs or racist ideology in those sentences. In fact, I don't see any race or races in general even mentioned. You're just one of those people who thinks you can win a discussion by accusing your opponents of being racist. Sorry simone, but in the real world, people can disagree with your leftist views (which are barely existent) without being racist."
sarc,And oddly enough you have been given several on silver platters. Perhaps you need to visit a neurologist and get checked for memory problems? Just to remind you once more - SICKLE CELL TRAIT is a mutation AND it benefits the phenotype under specific definable conditions. Do you really want to get hit about the head with that bat yet again?
sarc,You mean the truth of thousands of young teen girls dead with a coat hanger in hand? Abortion is a neccessity so that it can be regulated. People will have abortions legal or not legal. At least provide a safety net other than a coat hanger.
sarc,"So if Jitobear's mother had the option to abort Jitobear in utero, you want Jitobear to have the same option with any children she carries? That's awfully progressive of you."
sarc,"I think it would be best for neither one to have a gun, as there would be no chance of me getting hurt. After all, I could beat up a guy armed with a plastic fork. However, if the hijacker has a gun, I'd like someone (not me, I'm half blind in each eye, I'd probably hit a passanger or something) to have a gun."
sarc,  So what do ya Say! Come On. Be reasonable! Do it for the children! Or don't we care about these children because they weren't hurt or killed by a firearm?
sarc,Makes about as much sense as saying many of the car hating crowd (people who support such laws as car registration) also own cars. More evidence that your handlers have trained you to see the world in black and white.
sarc,Is North Korea a bastion of peace and good-living? Nope. Is it religious? Nope. Therefore obstacles to 'peace' don't necessarily have to be tied in with religiosity.  Hope that's spelt out enough for you. Try to keep up.
sarc,"Speaking from ignorance once again, eh SP? Did you, by chance, ever read the 2000 Census form? Did you happen to see the category ""unmarried partner""? I didn't think so. Now, go eat some crow. emoticonXHoho   http://www.census.gov/population/www...0/samesex.html"
sarc,Perhaps some people here aren't on the same level of intelligence. Seems you and chester understand it now so that is good.
sarc,"Yup, I get the drift. You're the sort that is in denial about how he feels about gays; equating tolerance for gays with tolerance for murderers, while pretending you're doing something else. Now I know how you think, thanks!"
sarc,"Worship me and I'll bless you too. With money of course. He can't even give you money. I am the true god and I created the mindset that he was a god in him. Worship me and spread the word about the true religion. Everyone who joins my church will instantly get $1,000 and after a week of membership you will get $1 million. The end of the week is when my project is and then you can go into the real world. All those who didn't believe in me will be destroyed when my world I created gets to the dump."
sarc,"Hmmm, was that an ad hominem attack? You know, what you accuse others of doing? Hypocrite."
sarc,"OMG, are you for real? I'd think that if you saw a plane flying low, being chased by a fighter jet, you'd get out of the way. Any SANE person would...  Further, you'd be peeved if you found out that it was your govt. being completely insensitive (not to mention wasteful). The govt. screwed up...if it had been Bush you'd be crying bloody murder."
sarc,"You of course have documentation of Darwin laying out his plan as to how to weasel evolution into classrooms to oust theism, right? No? You're making it all up? Shocking.  "
sarc,"Well, considering how ambiguous and contradictory the Christian scriptures are, I guess this interpetation makes as much sense as any of the others."
sarc,"Good, good, good, good and good. You should also know that Ron Paul will personally club one baby seal for every vote Hillary gets in the primary. He will then consume all socialists with fire from his eyes."

sarc,"Do you even read what anyone posts? Try it, you might learn something.......maybe not......."
sarc,Thanks for that little ad hominem! Shall I share with you my guesses about your motives?... But I digress.

sarc,didn't Kevin Costner do a movie about this in 1995?
sarc,"Clue: It's there in your own sentence. Five letters, beginning and ending with ""S"". If you need further interpretive assistance, don't bother with Sarge, she's waiting for an original thought."

sarc,Seems short compared to the hit list on infants since the last 36 ...
sarc,Oh? What keeps you from having 6 or eight or for that matter having crossed bandoleers across the chest?   I suspect kalifornia law will be changed a bunch and one in the pipe will be in vogue as well as a loaded mag in the gun for utility sake. You wouldn't want the perp to be disadvantaged too much now would you? How many shots must one allow the perp before you can fire back?
sarc,"Dude, my own father had hospice care in my home up until he died. I think I know a thing or two about it. None of what you say disproves that end-of-life can still be a scary thing.

sarc,"Absolutely, and I am suggesting we first attack Sweden. That's my plan. emoticonXBanghead emoticonXBanghead"
sarc,"That's military snipers, not for what passes for elite police in the land of the fruits and nuts. SEALS, Marines and Army for the most part."

sarc,WHAT QUOTES??? That's what I was asking you to repost because I can't find anything intelligent you have either posted or quoted at all!
sarc,I would be scared about a huge segment of society that considers me a clever ape.
sarc,I was right wasnt I? You do have buck teeth and play the banjo...look see if the Sesame street web site has a definition of zombie..what an arsehole lol
sarc,"Non-aggressive, yeah. That's why it's Israel that's the occupying force in Palestine and not the other way around. emoticonXWow"
sarc,Absolutely. Because atheists are spiritually constipated and are too dumb to realize God and Christ are real.
sarc,NONONONONONONO! I wasn't talking about you JoeBrummer I was talking about aNaCaLaGoN! Don't worry I try not to pick on people who don't like it!Right Sinjin?
sarc,"You know, if the God deniers even let the baby out of the mother's womb alive to begin with then he's already one step ahead of the game.  As for what to do with him then, show me under the New Covenant where Jesus said to stone kids?  Personally, I think we should stone obese, jaded statues of weird looking holy men."
sarc,"Eighty-nine times. Still quite a junior partner. I must admit that he doesn't like to be slighted though, as evidenced by Luke 12:10. One can say some nasty things about the Son of Man, and all's fine. But say one off-colored comment about the Holy Ghost and it's lakes-o-fire time. He needs to get thicker skin, IMO. Do ghosts have skin, BTW?   "
sarc,Do you have to have human organs to be considered a person? Who made this rule??? You? What if you get lung removed...are you less of a person? So around 8 weeks though you believe it is in fact a human?  
sarc,Maybe you are and maybe you are not. You can criticize but there again you may incur the wrath of ole Doc too. emoticonXSmilie  
sarc,"Trying to argue with a person who is babbling nonsense is not my idea of a productive time to spend my time. I've explained myself and that's the end of it.   You can label my posts anything you want but that doesn't mean anything. It just means you are proficient in throwing out insults. So for purposes of this discussion I crown you the ""insult king"" of this forum."
sarc,"He stated that "" statistics show that firearms cause aggression in individuals"", no mention of the word can anywhere in there that I saw."
sarc,That is exactly what he is here for. To spread god's.. 'love'.
sarc,that was a cheap shot my friend.. lets keep at around an a*d*u*l*t level.. shall we?
sarc,"What is this ""we"" stuff? Got a mouse in your pocket? I thought god was going to destroy it...not ""we"".   "
sarc,Quite true. Top that with the adolescent mentality exhibited by SP and the boys and you've got yourself a reason to consider calling Dr. Jack Kevorkian.  
sarc,"So most of your friends have had sex with your guy too? emoticonXGood  You and I both know that homosexuals have different partners regularly, at least compared to heterosexuals."

sarc,In the thousands of scientific papers that present the thousands of bits of evidence that go to prove evolution beyond all sensible sane and reasonable doubt.
sarc,But what makes them any different from ant hills or beaver dams? skyscrapers are natural because humans are a part of nature and they built them.
sarc,"I must say, you are quite a creepy addict. You seem pretty dangerous when high, especially since you think everything is a good idea. And why would you want his soul? emoticonXConfused Are you in a cult? Is that why you get high? I can see why teachers would need to go to attitude school after meeting you. They might need some help, as well as do you. And as contrary to your side subject, I think I am quite different than you."
sarc,"Can cause aggression, does not mean that it will though. Alcohol has a far greater record of this but yall are not trying to ban that. So do women but we arent going to ban them now are we, Sorry but I was in a marriage from hell and just had to throw that in."
sarc,"Nice attempt at an audition. Since the law firm you hired is supposed to find a director and president for your crumbled .org do you think you will get the job? What's the matter, didn't Hennigan cut it after the other lawyer fled when he saw the handwriting on the wall? emoticonXGood"
sarc,"I am actually getting my entertainment value out of WW and his lack of knowledge, along with his attempts to ########. If you or the others are bothered by his ignorant banter please let me know, and I will stop forcing him to give answers on subjects that he so obviously has no clue."

sarc,"When I think of the great minds of literature, Ann Coulter is certainly not on the top of my list. In fact, when I think of minds, I don't even think she has one. I hope that you write this in jest, otherwise...I would seriously suggest that you expand you horizons. emoticonXFrazzled"
sarc,"WOW are we seeing the softer, gentiler Jyoshu?   Your snoopy avatar must be afecting you :) :p"
sarc,BOY-HOWDY!!!!! You have spoken the truth and spoken it well. Welcome to you from the conservative South.
sarc,"So according to you, you'd prefer it if only the bad guys are armed, because that makes it easy to tell who's the bad guy and who's the good guy; being the good guy is never armed, and thus never able to defend themselves."
sarc,"And, I'm sure you ask yourself that very question before you unzip your fly and whip out your pecker, right?"
sarc,Ok if we can not use guns. Can we use baseball bats? Is that OK with you?
sarc,And the UN seems to feel it's necessary to spell out that you have the right to marry and have a family.
sarc,"And would guns in the hands of citizens have stopped that? Or does publicity, which has only increased since those events, stop them? Your selective reading ability is at work."
sarc,Nonsense. Just look at all the great things that the Dark Ages did for Europe!

sarc,I think he is just disturbed because he didn't get his 40 acres and mule?
sarc,Someone's help? Whoever are you talking about? It wasn't any much work at all. A simple search. I'm pointing it out to you in the hopes that you'll get some new material. That and the fact I'd rather not see you banned.
sarc,"I guess you never thought that many Cathoilics have gays in their family, or should they ask them to take their lives ?"
sarc,You'll never have that problem comic relief. You'll always be young mentally.
sarc,Where do you get off saying that kind of tripe to somebody?  That kind of insane comment is typical of far left loons like you who lie for a living and don't have the common sense of a fence post.  And that goes for Jo Bennett too if he's agreeing with you.  Cretins.
sarc,"Oh, EZ, so this god of yours wants to see ME, does he?  Well and good. Because when I have access to that god he is going to get an earful from me about how his people have screwed over the world."

Face it. You got pwned. Are you really not bright enough to recognize that?  "
sarc,"Did you actually read it? I suspect not. Did you think that I wouldn't? I suspect so. Did you think that no one here would have any knowledge of good old ""Kimisaurus"" (that's what it was tagged when Kim was telling us about it)? I suspect so.  "
sarc,Dragons and Dinosaurs coexisting only recently? hmm when they did dissapear? Maybe Conan the Barbarian killed them all!
sarc,"No EasyRidden.. It's you right wing fundies who have attempted for years to rewrite history to fit your religion into our constitution.

sarc,"I guess it's a good thing I wasn't replying and/or talking to you then. But thanks for your input, it has been noted."

So you don't believe that life had an origin! WOW so you think its always been present on the Earth? Not even the bible goes that far! And you fail to account for the observation that there IS life.   Thats not an evolutionary theory, at least not a scientific one. Kinds is a theological construct not a biological one and MOST creationists use the KINDS thing as a support for their arguments."
sarc,"ROFL....Yeah, right, since you 'left wingers' seriously see yourself as center-right.....whaddayah know?"
sarc,And you're baffled that you don't have more intelligent debate with people. I'm shocked.
sarc,"Math is confusing too, doesn't mean we should get rid of it."
sarc,"It has been 33 years. The allies managed to stop the holocaust in only two. You guys are certainly dragging your feet at stopping the great American ""holocaust"" against ""unborn babies."""
sarc,"It truly is sad when an opponent is friendlier than an ally, Mega. At least Ian responded in a friendly way, and me and him don't even agree on this issue."
sarc,"Archie, you're not one of those Westboro Baptist Chuch types, are you? You don't buy that stuff about 'God Hates the ### Army' and 'God hates America' do you?"
sarc,Oh thats not politically kerect and secially wif the chosen one doing the world apology toure I don't see that going down.   Well lay a few on us sin baby. Give us the deal.
sarc,"I guess they could if they knew where all the parts were located. Oh, I would think they would be in hell. I can't imagine ""God"" would have anything to do with mass murderers; do you?   BTW, this is Osama's technical guide for the terrorists.   http://www.almostaproverb.com/images4/osama_dummies.jpg"
sarc,So let's just kill them and be done with it. Is that what you're saying?
sarc,"And what does he mean by that? You apparently don't have a clue. Tell me, do you have any idea what ""secondary cause"" is?"
sarc,Aw declare victory and slither off eh. I made an assertof fact that was backed up. You made a strawman of abandonment. No one made that claim but you. They come here because they don't get the proceedure in a timely manner. Get it now? Hence you lose as usual.
sarc,"Actually, isn't it creationists who claim that the universe was created from nothing? Creationists even have a magazine formally called ""Ex Nihilo"" (changed to ""Creation"" because creationists didn't know what it meant.)"
sarc,"So you carry grenades and 75 pounds of gear, all while wearing camouflage fatigues and can call in an airstrike bombing?"
sarc,"Where are those organizations with such scientific rigor? If they truly do exist, they must be in the position to understand the God of the Gaps they're worshipping has become microscopic."
sarc,"I don't care for the respect of utter nincompoops. I'm happy to tolerate them, but don't expect me not to laugh at them."
sarc,Primarily from your side of the aisle in all arguments. You really described yourself a T.
sarc,So this singularity that appeared out of no were became a greater singularity which took on perfect balance and form?
sarc,"Prove something besides your ignorance? Homo-erectus and Neandertals differ in cranium size, bone size, bone structure, number of bones as well as the length and width of individual bones. I can see why people are laughing at you"
sarc,"So you're claiming that you ""transformed"" from part of your mother to a human. So you're claiming that you were once almost your mom's arm or leg? lol! Biologically, this is simply a farce statement."
sarc,Here's a novel idea - how about the right gives up the abstinence programmes (scientifically unproven) and improves access to and information on b/c to stop women having UPPs in the first place? Just a thought.
sarc,"You should really think about what you say before you say it. I have heard this before and its garbish, I have been around and owned guns my whole life and I have never, not even once, had the thought of getting a gun just because someone ###### me off. I would never use a gun on a person unless that person were a viable threat to my life, such as coming at me with a knife for example."
sarc,"Selective reading huh? Well, there is none so blind as he who will not see."
sarc,Well with thinking challenged individuals like slimjim floating around it is no wonder we have a rogue agency with no oversight attacking the honest citizens. See Ruby Ridge and Waco for examples.
sarc,You know you have outwitted a conservative thinker when they completely dodge the argument you have made.
sarc,"Now you are being insulting. Evolution makes no statments about your god. For that matter, neither does cosmology, astronomy, chemistry, physics or geology."
sarc,Ah yes resort to attack when you have no case - perfect example. Its a marvellous demonstration of projection.
sarc,"So if a jew tells a big nose joke, he's saying that all jews have big noses? This is a joke thread; I posted a joke, get over it."
sarc,"And you have just described ""creation science."" No application of the scientific method. No testing. The conclusions are known before the judicious quoting of scientific authority has even begun. I notice that you use one of those quotes of a scientific authority below. You show that you are what you decry."
sarc,Functioning? The fetus breathes freely? It cries when it is hungry or uncomfortable? It demands attention? It smiles and coos and is cute to those who behold it?  Wow! Didn't know that fetuses were that active and functional.
sarc,"i dont like watching videos. or following steps. isnt there just one thing i could do? you know, like be forgiven or whatever?"
sarc,"They can't, if you value science and common sense, however, science and common sense are irrelevent in their world."
sarc,"I don't see how you figure that. Are you intoxicated by any chance? I'm not trying to insult you, I'm serious. You're not writing well, and I'm not refering to your point either."
sarc,"Ahh but what if all the shirts have only american flags on them. Would it them be a group of patiotic americans and their children? I mean you do tend to see american flag wear, including tee shirts, everywhere. Would it still be considered a protest if all of them had american flag shirts on them.  AHHHH Joe I it hit me of course this is like Ghandis' salt march."
sarc,Thank you for this thoughtful exposition on the historicity of your loving mentor.
sarc,You jsut don't get it. You act like two wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for lunch. You as a hetero get to go and get married to the person of your choice but I do not. What part of that do you not understand. You say this isn't personal and for you this is true but for me the man I love is nothing but a stranger to me in the eyes of the law. How cruel can you be
sarc,Er . . . how do you know that god hasn't told anyone to kill enmasse (in the last 2000 years)? Does he run all his orders by you?
sarc,Where? I don't see it. My monkey brain's fine but my eyes aren't what they used to be.  I'm guessing we're through discussing the legality of armed self-defense in Australia given the flurry of OT links?
sarc,"Oh, if we only had the requisite absolute civilian gun bans, sick things like this would never happen! Huh Brady?"
sarc,"Maybe you aren't aware, but something that hasn't happend but has a possibility or probability of happening is potential, so the word is accurate to describe it. And since I'm sure Steeeeve (the dictionary worshipper) will step in, here is the definition:  "
sarc,So your biased reading of the Bible coupled with your personal flaws and your misunderstanding of science is the basis of your religiosity? Somehow I don't think that's something you'd really want to brag about...
sarc,"Well then, I guess I must be a turkey-sandwich worshipper! emoticonXAngel"
sarc,"But I thought it was the easy gun laws in the U.S. that made Mexico's cities a shooting gallery? Same as L.A. and less than D.C.?   Amid Drug War, Mexico Less Deadly Than Decade Ago"
sarc,Again he was under attack. Listen to yourself. And talk about a parrot?   No one is arguing Saddam was a saint. But he wasn't and threat and he wasn't insane enough to commit sucide. You are too busy being a lemming and being led over the cliff with president Shrub (Molly Irvins -- GW is to small to be a Bush). ;)
sarc,"After Rump Limpballs and his XXXXX followers started calling me a ""Feminazi"", I was granted a license to call TeaBaggers TeaBaggers."
sarc,"Better still , you pop down to your local army barracks and explain it to thememoticonXClown"
sarc,"So? God also says he made you out of dirt and then supernaturally lifting the dirt from the ground into the woman's uterus. Oh well, I suppose it is all beliefs no matter how silly it sounds."
sarc,  well there is an educated answer :) thanks for the feedback
sarc,That is a completely subjective assessment. Thelmoose and Unkerpaulie were already quick to dissociate themselves from any smugness or self righteousness on this very thread.   It's a schism! I'm filing for their excommunication! emoticonXWow
sarc,"You should watch where you cast stones, kido. Your original post is an example of a straw man...not mine. You should be more careful before operating a gun...you just yourself in the foot. LOL!"
sarc,"Damn, had 2 of them on my doorstep yesterday. Why didn't I think of that?"
sarc,"You are apparently unwilling to extend your thinking process to the other side of the argument Galileo, and by this I mean, and repeat that it isn't criminals owning hand guns which we defenders of gun rights are fighting for. WE AGREE THAT CRIMINALS SHOULDN'T BE ARMED, and the laws already exist on the books to punish them when convicted criminals are caught with guns. But your solution to disarm all honest citizens in the belief that this will make them unavailable to criminals also is ludicrous to the point of self destructive insanity. It is that premise which we are fighting against through the NRA and other lobbying efforts."
sarc,"From the threads I see, you would be banned in 10 posts, and everything deleted. The level of discourse over there intelligence over there makes ER looks semi-intelligent."
sarc,"So the Establishment Clause was included to promote atheism, eh?"
sarc,None... unless she uses abortion as a form of birth control and has them regularly.
sarc,"well, then why are the doctors trying 2 also test the embyonic cells? what's their reason then? we don't know, because the doctors might not want everything that they're doing be on the front page of every newspaper. they have their reasons for their actions, and they just don't want people like you to know about them. or...they already have their reasons published and everything and you're just 2 close-minded 2 take the information in."
sarc,"That's right, a broken clock tells the right time twice a day, and gun hating hoplophobes are never right."
sarc,"Thanks for contributing absolutely nothing as you make unfounded claims without supporting them with even the slightest proof. But hey, talks cheap; and you've proven you've got plenty of that since showing up here."
sarc,...that is on every single one of his posts? Still going to claim you read other peoples stuff properly?
sarc,And I suppose you feel it would've been better if she died at the hands of a knife-wielding killer?
sarc,"I know this may seem obvious to most people, but it seems to have escaped the notice of creationists. Birds are tetrapods, as are amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. Birds didn't just grow wings. Wings are adaptions of the front limbs that were covered with feathers. Perhaps you are unaware of the evidence that indicates that maniraptors had feathers, probably for thermoregulation. Saying that there is no mechanism for birds to grow wings when they previously had none is like saying that there is no mechanism for mankind to grow arms when he previously had none. You see, mankind's closest relatives are the two species of chimpanzee - they are quadrupeds."
sarc,Well you'd know fascist wingnuts for sure. Hitting a meeting tonite?
sarc,Yawn.. you are so obsessed with gay sex. I am not. Enough said.
sarc,"Oh, yea. You are damn right those European socialists are dangerous. Americans might look and see their governments actually doing something USEFUL for the people and think that we should have that here.   I am surprised we have not nuked them yet."
sarc,"WHAT??? Jito, are you saying that motherhood is difficult? emoticonXWow Now that's a shock..."
sarc,"Did you even read ythe OP? Did you even read the title?   Pointless distinction? Huh.   I understand what you are saying. I also know you are changing your argument. When it was proven that Sanford did indeed run on family values, you changed your argument. Instead of just owning up and admitting that, you weasel out of it.   "
sarc,"You would not celebrate Osama being out of the picture? Maybe not throw a party, but a not even a simple ""yippee!""?   Yeah, right. What a load."
sarc,"But there seem to be so darn many of them, everywhere you look among the religious right. Why is that? Can't they go out and recruit people with IQs somewhat above room temperature?"
sarc,"You should use the same quote when whining about use of partial quotes, and not introduce different ones. Nozza made a false assertion and was refuted with his own words. You introduce a different false assertion and fail. Epically."
sarc,Could you avoid your constant use of strawman`s fallacies please?
sarc,"Then you would have to be believe that out of the supposed millions upon millions of people who walked the Earth none of them were pregnant and there were no newborns either. Then again, to be Christian, you also have to believe the world was created in 7 days and their was a Biblical great flood too. The best part about writing a fairytale is that the author gets to make up everything as they go along."
sarc,"Yes, some people are jumping ship, which is a crying shame. STICK TO YOUR GUNS MEN! WE'RE WINNING!"
sarc,Want to know how to make a gay sex liberal mad and whine? Tell him the truth.  Then they get their knickers in a wad and whine for the politically correct policeman.  p.s. Unless Mother Theresa repented she will not have gone to heaven either.
sarc,"Sorry, I was busy looking at your Base21 source, the one where you post your own article. I figured someone had made up an article on it.   Hey, according to PNC=WW3, if I don't like the people who put the information into the State Dept. website, I don't have to believe it. That's according to him."
sarc,"But you are the accuser. I've read the Bible and I have studied religion, more than you can imagine. I have also studied biology, performed experiments and reached conclusions. The problem is that you seem unable to think for yourself."
sarc,"You say some of us are lying and then you say you apologize ""if"" we're ""somehow"" offended. Gee, that's mighty white of you."
sarc,"You're right it'll be fighting the war in Iraq. )Nah, really it'll be from social security, etc etc."
sarc,Too late. I am a child of the 70's. My mind evaporated decades ago.emoticonXDonno
sarc,Thats why I say my gayness is His gift and blessing to me. There is nothing more joyous then gay sex.
sarc,"You missed out mean-spirited, which fits like a very well fitting glove."
sarc,Which ones? Ineffective how?   I'd guess the laws weren't struck down simply because too many people broke them.
sarc,glad to know you bring spelling into this. Shows where you are in the argument. And where did the life saving question come from?
sarc,"I disagree. Well, only in that I think it's high time we held everybody to a higher standard. We should suspend hetero marriage until they clean up their act!"
sarc,"Oh gosh, silly, silly me, not blaming an entire group of people for something a few nutjobs did. My, I'm so embarassed for being so intolerant and thinking that! emoticonXBangheademoticonXBanghead  "
sarc,"I don't know? How about a person from a group known to do almost anything to get money, but also realises the pain they would bring to a child if they had one."
sarc,"You still don't get it do you, Smiley... emoticonXBanghead   If cupcakes were human? It would."
sarc,Every time the KKK burns a cross NRA members are there. So what? Every time they burn a cross Christianity is there.
sarc,"Try the ( Law of Common Sense) . If your an ex-atheist, you already know the ( Law of Relativity )."
sarc,"First off, no one says that if there is evil, there can't be a God. They say that if there's evil, then God can't be omnipotent and all benevolent. Let's keep the topics straight. Also, I see no way in which the existence of good bolsters the argument that God exists. I could posit the existence of a God of popcorn, and then say ""look, here's some popcorn, my God must be real!"" Somehow, I don't think that would convince you."
sarc,"Lotsa gay animals out there, man. Wonder what Jaaaman's sources are. He seems very perturbed by homosexuality."
sarc,Good observation! He is very good at presenting fellatious viewpoints and lack of knowledge and content. He is one of the more fellatious people I know and you won't find him taking notice of the Constitution as the Supreme Law of the Land either.
sarc,"You can take a horse to water. I provided evidence to support my assertion. You provided ............ ""Oh no it isn't!"""
sarc,"probably because this is an abortion forum and not a forum about the Iraq War..not only that, there is no parallel."
sarc,So you evolved and the aryan race was created by God? I have never heard that before.
sarc,"I'm not interested in who isn't hitting on you. Do you want an ugly, flaming, gay cellulite blubber-wench hitting on you for three years or not??? Or maybe a pod of those whales all hitting on you??  For the record, gays make normal men's skin crawl, and not in a good way. So keep the spiritually-challenged heathens out of the men's barracks, and out of their showers. Just because you and the rest of the pro-gay crowd thinks that kind of depraved activity is ok doesn't mean the rest of society does."
sarc,Of course you don't. It's the natural humanistic way of thinking.
sarc,"Jyoshu, stop drinking the Kool-Aid before your brain is totally fried."
sarc,So taking peoples rights away is an american value? I think I will push for legislation to make cancer surgery illegal. After all cancer cells are human life too and with modern medical tech they could become a human being also.
sarc,Will the Catholics ever elect somebody who is not a complete knob? He speaks just like he knows something about gay relationships. emoticonXRolleyes
sarc,You never bought something you liked? You never went somewhere with someone you liked or went to meet them?   
sarc,"It is supported, I have shown that it is true. Your only argument is to claim that organisations that perpetrate genocide don't agree that it is genocide. Wow what an argument you have.  "
sarc,"Oh, oh, and don't forget to include the proposed Federal Kosher Amendment's text, which just coincidentally matches the Levitical proscriptions, in your argument that things like the FMA have nothing to do with separation of church and state."
sarc,"And here it is, corrected to remove that little hint of sensationalism that you feel is needed to drum up support for your cause."
sarc,Only in the mind of a secular humanist atheist would it make sense. emoticonXGood
sarc,"What, you mean like this story (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3136266.stm) of scientists warning about ocian acidity levels from 2003? Global warming is old news too: it doesn't seem to have reached the more remote parts of the world though, like North America for example."
sarc,"So if I go out and buy a Brand X car and then regret it a year later, does that mean that nobody should be allowed to go out and buy a Brand X car? Am I entitled to have an opinion and share it with others...sure. However, could others purchase a Brand X car and never regret it...absolutely. Should my negative experience be used to prevent others from engaging in something that they might consider positive? Sounds kinda fascist to me."
sarc,Turned?  What do you mean turned?  (Oh man! Got you one more time! Brutal! lol)
sarc,"As compared to ""Truth"" (capital T). Yes, creationist theocrats have this tendency to portray their subjective beliefs as truth, their wishful thinking as facts. No surprise there.  "
sarc,This remark would be funny if you didn't actually mean it....
sarc,Based on what besides your own immediate knee-jerk denials?  You're always in the tank for the Bible bashers.
sarc,"Abortion is not immoral? End of story? Simone, are you trying to impose your own personal moral code upon me? Well I never...."
sarc,"pay attention to what ? to the voices in your head ?   your age is irrelevant to your recognized lack of intelligence, but being a minor would be relevant since it would excuse your ignorance.  My advice to you ?  keep all your life pretending in forums that you are just a kindergarten kid and therefore people would think that for a 4 year old kid you are not too dumb and of course knowing nothing is understandable."
sarc,I truly mourn for you cookie. I pity the emptiness and shallowness of your soul. emoticonXCry
sarc,Brave words. Next they'll be limiting free speech. Oh wait. Done that already.  
sarc,"Indeed true. God created man in his own likeness and man returned the favor. Man created a vindictive, vengeful, and vicious god, according to the Bible. So where does a loving god come from?"
sarc,Right. Catholics say prayers to a woman that they hate. Next!
sarc,ROFL you don't even believe that given the democrat party's known escapades. I do hope you haven't stroked out due to the Brown victory. Let the games begin!
sarc,You really don't get it. The best thing about a free market is when someone acts like a fool they get burned. Thanks to government intervention and regulation when someone acts like a fool they get bailed out.   If you like we can have the trains run like Amtrak.
sarc,Oh no an open minded church that doesn't hate? GASP! And sorry but the bible has many interpretations as is clearly seen in the WIDE and VAST amount of differing denominations. Just because their not closes binded right wing bigots doesn't mean you can grill them cause their interpretation is different...
sarc,"Just out of interest, which particular aspect of ""truth"" are you getting at here?"
sarc,"Ah yes, the 'Let's pull a smug and self serving quote out of context from the bible and use it as in insult, therefore god exist' routine. That arrogant method of using self congratulatory bible quotes to insult and denigrate your opponent is neither an effective debate technique, or does it help convince those people on the boarder line to convert to Christianity. It does drive them away, so please, be my guest and keep on trying to use it. I figure the ratio of people you drove away from Christianity to those people who were converted to Christianity from you must be way lop sided."
sarc,"Interesting.... have you ever been to a schoolyard recently? I think the ""taunts"" are more directed at gays. Like ""f@ggot"" and ""fairy"". What taunts do you get on a daily basis? What... being called out on your negativity towards the rights of a minority? boo hoo."
sarc,"But that is how creationism works - half truth. Evolution is a theory but don't make it quite clear that in science the word theory doesn't mean half-assed guess, as it does in creationism. Check out that little piece of **** that was added to the bottom of the Patterns of Cumulative Change paragraph on page 7. That is pure YEC. And you aren't a YEC?"
sarc,"I think we're seeing a culture war. Hardly seems a fair fight though, since only one side has any.:p"
sarc,"You'd have to drown a few puppies too. Kittens might do, but you might fall a little short."
sarc,"I believe we have a human responsibility to one another. That we are our brother's keeper. Tell me, Bassman, if there aren't enough jobs, and the costs of medical care are skyrocketing through the roof, what do you suggest your fellow Americans do? Just drop dead?"
sarc,"Oh boy,,.. I got ignored with a potty remark. Why is that not surprising?"
sarc,"Why do ""they"" want it to be true? Some ""gay"" science agenda?"
sarc,Seems all the drills would broadcast when they had a leftie. Just could wait for that case of M-1 thumb or the hot one down the shirt.
sarc,"So, you have no problem with the fact that this is abortion and was caused by god?"
sarc,"Well, you're writing from an embryo's point of view, when an embryo doesn't even have a point of view. It would be like writing from a rock's point of view."
sarc,I didn't know that doctors have the constitutional right to perform abortions. What provision in the Constitution guarantees that right?
sarc,Well that lets out most of the supreme court when RvW comes up! And of course 1/2 give or take of the voters would be disqualified if relevant issues come up to a vote. Perhaps we should start an effort to amend the constitution to incorporate your idea!
sarc,I see you missed the entire point of my post. Good job on analyzing the sarcastic opening though.
sarc,"Wow! ...... If your interpretation were correct, there would be a connection between his post and the USSR! But it's not, and there isn't."
sarc,"Oh, I see. So America does not care for the rights of the people? America cares only for the opinion of the majority? Hrm, that's funny. I fail to remember learning that part in all my US history classes. When did the founding fathers say that? Where in the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, or the Bill of Rights might I find such a notion?  'Rouge"
sarc,Is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? Is Sarah Palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?
sarc,What does spelling have to do with your own opinion? Again this isn't just about you although I think you did resort to correcting someone's spelling and just didn't answer the question. This has nothing to do with being entitled to your own opinion. It is equally bad for anyone to resort to personal attacks on either side of the debate.
sarc,"So then how do you know that abortion isn't in the plan then? If as you say we have ""VERY LIMITED PERSPECTIVE"""
sarc,since when has religion been pragmatic or based upon systems that works?  Obvious answer: never.
sarc,A nameless face to the feds? In this era of paranoia and fear and overgrown governments? As if any of us are private and unknown individuals anymore.
sarc,The poor in the US certainly seem to eat more than the rich in most countries.
sarc,"Hey Jitobaby - if you're that insecure with your beliefs that you have to throw this kind of a snit when people are making a case contrary to your failed radical liberalism, then maybe you need to watch Michael Moore on TV instead of reading my posts."
sarc,"Now you've ruined it! You're not supposed to mention god. That's the whole idea. ID is stealth creationism. XXXXXX pretend that there is some scientific basis for the assertion that there is some sort of magical designer that is responsible for everything, but they don't say it's god. If they did that, then ID would be religion and introducing it into schools would be unconstitutional."
sarc,Just because you fail to realize what the article says doesn't make what you said true. Since you seem to like logical fallacies can you reconginze which one you just committed?
sarc,So your claim that no pre-existing belief is necessary is untested by you. Do you have an example of an actual non-believer having a religious experience that made a believer of them? In my experience God never appears to atheists. Funny that.
sarc,"So atheists are capable of goodness, love, kindness, generosity and sympathy but they have no meaning unless one conforms the the fundamentalist christian morality."
sarc,"Crouching Libertarian, Hidden cost. Can't pay extra expenditures get's ya penalized! No special education requirements (they are't unders state or federal control!) No requirement to moniter student progress...that seems safe."
sarc,Yes...I think I would agree with you. That's what happens when you have superstition coupled with self-imposed ignorance I suppose. It's a shame!
sarc,"Please tell me, why did you believe your pastor, but not me? What did he say that was so convincing? And please, PLEASE, tell me what you think the Bible might not be saying that could have any bearing on this in the slightest. How can the fact that we don't know Ehosh's second cousin twice removed have any bearing on this at all, or whatever you think the Bible wasn't saying?  "
sarc,I was hoping that talking in Old English would help him understand.
sarc,"Where, exactly, did the article say that bacteria exhibit intelligence????"
sarc,Right on! The Obama administration is a colossal financial disaster. If he doesn't have another trillion dollars to XXXX he can't do anything. Tax and spend - that's all those liberal turkeys know how to do.
sarc,"Compared to what? The U.S.? That would be laughable if it wasn't so serious, it is plain ridiculous. The CDC and NAS studies Tither has posted so many times still hasn't sunk it has it? There is no benefit to any gun control law that has been studied! Now here you are ignoring and contradicting scientific facts...again. Take Chicago, they have strict gun laws and have over 3 times the national rate of murders."
sarc,"You mean you've spent your good, hard-earned money on his revisionist follies? ROTFLOL!! You could have had a six pack to really make your day."
sarc,"Why does they admin let EZ post comments like this to other people, if he can't be vicl and debate like an adult to others, why is he here......to spread god's love ...right?"
sarc,Just which god might that be? Yahweh? Krishna? he Great Spirit? Allah?  Please specify.
sarc,Looks like dancing in the blood of innocents to me.
sarc,"Oh I understand plenty. What you want is a system where a person is held responsible for crimes that they didn't commit. You want ""guilty by association"" extended to the point of ridiculousness where anybody who even met the criminal even once can be held as an accomplice."
sarc,"Uhhhh, I just said that I DO JUDGE! So what in the hell are you talking about? You're not well. I didn't bother to adress your points about slavery because there's no point. I disagree with your claims as I suspect would most historians. But it doesn't surprise me that Christians would try to claim that they ended slavery since they also try to falsely claim they founded the country."
sarc,"All science is provisional. For absolutes, we look to your interpretation of your bible. That's always absolute and beyond any correction.  "
sarc,I can understand your disappointment. Its very difficult to cure someone of chronic religious delusions. No easy way to relieve the suffering of the victim. But if you really work hard at it for another decade or so you may recover yet. Best of luck and don't fall for the quacks peddling quick cures.
sarc,"Oh look, Gansao the blowhard is still living in his world of ignorance and denial... like his daddy Ezridden.   You couldn't educate a rock ya stupid bastard.emoticonXBye"
sarc,"I guess since he said so it must be true... poor daewoo, just remember only whiners point out logic fallacies like ad hominem and argument by dismissal."
sarc,"Are you sure? VOR is a 14 year old kid from Florida. His IP is squarely from a ISP from Florida. If he is retired, he is the first person I have ever heard who was 60+ that used slang normally reserved for street gangs. Not to mention that his war stories place him in two different seas at the same time. Somehow 2 tours turned into 4, midlevel ship officer turned into high ranking military advisor.   All in all, VOR is far more of a liability to any of his allies because of his lying, lack of education and reading comphrension problems."
sarc,I have. Yet I can`t seem to be able to do the creative math that will show that europe will become pre-dominatly muslim in any near future.  
sarc,"Evidence? We're talking religion here. Religion. If there were evidence, then it would be science."
sarc,"But religion is not a topic for science classes. Teach the science in class and if that presents a problem for your religion at home, perhaps you should think about your religion a bit more critically and realistically. What is being attempted is to cast doubt on well established scientific theory and pretend that magic is a viable alternative."
sarc,Perhaps then the problem is a shortage of fiber in you diet?
sarc,Our pumping of CO2 is certaintly not helping. Does that mean we should pump gasses and make people in big cities sneeze?
sarc,"I could have labeled my post ""TRAP"" and you wouldn't notice. Tell me, are these two contradictory:  "
sarc,"If truth makes you uncomfortable, feel free not to respond to me. I will continue to point out hypocrisy , and bigotry. I'll mock anybody who says 'slavery wasn't all that bad' either."
sarc,"Yes, I will mark that on my calendar for future reference.....get help man....really...you need it."
sarc,"Seriously, in part is Waxy saying, I was here first? (It's my forum, I'll whine if I want to.)"
sarc,I also took a look and think your evaluation is charitable.
sarc,"Actually they apologised because it's a bit of a fad amongst the limp-wristed politicians at the moment. And anyway, the blood is fairly even on both sides."
sarc,"Ah yes, the ever popular 3rd grade ""they started it"" response. Didn't jesus say to turn the other cheek?"
sarc,Care to post some proof or should everyone just believe it because you say it?..
sarc,You show me the post where I said I thought terrorists killing children was a good idea and I will eat my keyboard.
sarc,"But if this was a republican program, you'd have no problem with it. You are a rightwing hypocrite, Archie Baby."
sarc,"And you know what I think? I think that everyone who doesn't have sex 24 hours a day 7 days a week is denying human beings life every second. I'm sure some of those sperm would love to have the chance to breathe the air that you are breathing in vain because you don't think they should live [/sarcasm]. Why don't you think this? Why embryos? Embryos are the one thing that have great potential to cause harm in a woman, and you just so happen to choose them as human beings. Very suspicious..."
sarc,True they should have passed raincoats and knee boots to protect peoples clothes from the XXXX that the president was spewing out.
sarc,"This, coming from an atheist. How consistently shallow of you. emoticonXRolleyes"
sarc,"yea, I often forget ToE is a mental concept, not a scientific one. Nothing -- and I mean nothing -- will ever dismantle it in the minds of the faithful. Materialism is so entrenched in your mind that even if an animal generates a new piece of morphology by mere thought, sensation or awareness, and then passes that trait down to progeny, (which has been shown on here) you still think materialism stands. It's an unfalsifiable mindset that you and millions of others have created for yourselves."
sarc,Well it depends he could always be a sperm donor or make some Lesbian couple happy :)
sarc,"No, I for one dislike your posts because I know you intentionally write irrational posts to help support your religious cause.   Just for the record montalban, basically every single legitimate scientist is ""pro-evolution"". Creation theory is not taught in public schools, not by chance, but because...*gasp* it's RELIGIOUS MUMBO JUMBO. There is no evidence to support it. Creation fiction has made no progress with it's ""faith-based"" (lackofevidence) with rational people.   And I'll also say that I'd welcome ad hominem over irrational thinking any day. Ad hominem is just a lack of patience, or someone who doesn't care to hide their emotion or opinion. Irrational thinking on the other hand is often only cured by death. Someone guilty of ad hominem can still hold a rational debate. The irrational..well, why bother?   -Mach"
sarc,"How about other religious theories. What about teaching about the sun god? I don't mean that they believed that, but teach it as a choice because everyone deserves the right to choose in what they believe. Actually let's also teach how the theory of gravity could be wrong and people can choose to believe that invisible fairys pull people down towards the Earth and other massive objects. We should teach the theory of gravity also but we need to give them the choice on what to believe.  "
sarc,"Excuse me, I stand corrected. For 'pretend' please substitute 'wrongly believe'."
sarc,No surprise there. You would have to invest some thought to define something. Why don't you just consult your Little Golden Dictionary?
sarc,"Actually, I don't sneer at you. I laugh at you. And I don't attack your intelligence but your knowledge. You are intentionally ignorant."
sarc,That sort of warms the cockles of my heart. Namely that some Europeans might be disinclined to visit or stay here. Don't let the door hit you in the buttocks on the way out.
sarc,So the BBC folks are frauds and liars? You really are an idiot aren't you? Piltdown Bird is a colorful way of saying it was a Piltdown like fraud.   National Geographic knew it was a fake and published the article anyway.  Of course you probably still believe in the original Piltdown don't you?  You probably believe the Nebraska Man and Haeckels speechless apes were real too.  There is an echo when you think isn't there?
sarc,"Cool I want to be free of the regulation that I wash my hands before preparing other peoples food. After all it should be my choice to wash my hands after going to the restroom and I should be able to make that choice without restraint. In your world there are no courts, police, or governments to hold me accountable for killing someone or giving them hepatitis."
sarc,Well bravo for you - they must not be all that good considering. Or did you simply learn to be deceptive yourself and confuse that with deception by others? Who can say?
sarc,"your ""minds""? How many do you have? Oh, and ""I wanted to see what inferior it was""? Nice example of your supposed superiority."
sarc,I'm glad that you're the one living in fear of becoming a criminal for defending your family and not me.
sarc,I have an entire New Testament. You've got what - a mouthful of denial? When you get to the level of the NT works let us know.
sarc,And you tell people not to call you a gay basher? LOLemoticonXRolleyes emoticonXRolleyes emoticonXCensored   I know very well what faux means - that is the reason it is bashing to call someone's marriage that.
sarc,I won't hold my breath awaiting a retraction of this piece of balderdash you've composed. Guess we'll chalk it up to puffery.
sarc,"You see, that's the problem: ""generally"". You obviously know little or nothing of how prejudice works in this country."
sarc,"Well, at least you are more consistent about equality than a lot of people in your movement.   "
sarc,"I know that. Evolution releases itself from its foundation at will. When it wants to speculate about things like abiogenesis and claim it to be science, it allows itself to do that. It's that interchangeability thing you spoke of above."
sarc,"And yet after investigating for over a year, our inspectors agree with me, not you. Hmmm."
sarc,"All sin undermines society, including illicit gay sex sin. Or have you forgotten Sodom and Gomorrah? Coming to a San Francisco bath house near you."
sarc,If you don't get all 10 according to landover you are not a true christian.

sarc,"I'm actually in the Detroit Subs with one kid in a Blue Ribbon High School and two in college nearby. And yes, the mayor's got the bling goin on in his wife's city-leased Escalade. I'm not sure if it has ""dubs"" on it or not, though, but I bet the stereo's kickin'. :)"
sarc,"HELLO!! THAT'S WHY!! Then we see the standard dance of how innocent and objective science really is.   6) And the standard ""theistic evolution"" dance. Atheistic evolutionists can't get along without it! I wonder if Kenneth Miller will see the movie, and comment on it. I wonder if he'd have refused to be a part of it."
sarc,So what you are saying is that the actual purpose of prison is to be raped in the shower by some 400 pound guy called Betty? Or brutalised by a guard with an inferiority complex...and these don't strike you as cruel and unusual?
sarc,Isn't the point pretty obvious- that exposure to a gun can raise testosterone levels and trigger violent and aggressive thoughts and actions?
sarc,Yea they get over it in a year or two. Haaa Haaa
sarc,So you yourself could have gone gay but chose to be attracted to women?
sarc,"Spain, unlike most modern democracies, very very recently had the uh.. privilege of living under a strong, ""moral"" government that supported the uh.. ""family values"" so important to the right.   That they are running like hell away from it should tell people something."
sarc,"So now name calling and accusations as to my mental health are what you concider as rational thought?   I expect that you must be some sort of expert on warfare, in paticular this war? Am I to believe that you are a soldier there now?   Your rage towards me in your post only shows just how easily upset you are. I posted exactly what I meant to and you went off on a tangent. I asked you for proof and all you can do is a schoolyard tactic if ""show me yours before I show mine?"" Pitiful."
sarc,"Oh, sorry, I didn't think that was a serious answer. Thanks."
sarc,Hehehe. Sounds like an American in a big SUV looking at $4/gallon gasoline with a maxed out credit card listening to fundamentalist talk radio.
sarc,"Cute. And I can come up with about 5,000 to 7,000 examples that do have a bright orange muzzle."
sarc,"Oh...come on Steeeeve...you know Bush is actually making it worse. After all, it is happening on Obama's watch, and we have got to have someone to blame. Bush was the president...let's just blame him. emoticonXRolleyes"
sarc,"Judicial activism? What brand of stupid is it that you use? What judicial activism do you see here; the judge stating that open carry is legal and has been, and that you can't be arrested when you haven't committed a crime? Or that the police can be sued for damages when they choose to break the law to persecute an innocent bystander?"
sarc,"So you're saying that God is a ""respector""?-of-persons - iow, the mom's ""more""-important to *God*? than the unborn."

sarc,And the funeral dirge of the Left and comparisons to Nazi Germany and/or the collapse of the Roman Empire will begin in 3....2.....
sarc,"Losing again I see. Don't change the subject. How are supporting 'gay sex debauchery' and lying in any way synonymous?  You have made the accusation. Back it up.  If different words are too much for your miniscule brain to cope with, I suggest you try yelling your hogwash on a street corner, where less people will be able to see how much of a fool you are."
sarc,"I'd be pretty dumb to buy something from someone who doesn't even believe in what they're selling. Those teachers may teach it, but they don't believe in it."
sarc,"No. Not only are you wrong, you seem to lack the integrity to learn the basics of what you claim to oppose. You oppose evolution you say, but you have no idea of what it is. Most educated creationists not only admit evolution, they propose evolution at rates that make real biologists laugh."
sarc,When I want the opinion of a spiritually-dead nincompoop I'll call you.
sarc,"So, it's a proven fact that children denied the act of abortion suffer negative effects? Hmmmmmm"
sarc,"But you sure don't hesitate to portray them that way when you use one to bolster the other!

Hey, it's just accuracy, so why get in a fuss over it, huh? emoticonXRolleyes Why not go ahead and invoke the Jewish genocide while you're at it, or call anyone who has a different opinion ""Hitler?""

sarc,"Here is yet another example of Duo holding other people's arguments to a higher standard than he holds his own. Duo, you said ""Second, no one call actually tell the age of anyone here. To declare such when the verifiability that the claim depends on does not exist is sheer insanity."" Are you right? Anyone claiming to know age on these boards without evidence is insanity? Duo, if you are right, you are calling yourself insane. That's not going to help you out on the credibility meter. Perhaps you might want to amend some of you posts?"

sarc,How uninteresting must that be for you to intentionally spend time annoying people on the internet?
sarc,"NO, gun registration should not be mandatory anywhere in the US. The government has no business knowing who has a gun. Gun registration could possibly allow the government to infringe on constitutional guarantees provided by the Bill Of Rights. Just knowing that there are many Senators and Congressmen who would like to abolish gun rights gives credence to the fact that government could actually try to limit or ban the 2nd Amendment in the future.   P.S. Crazy is as Crazy says. Scary to think that some would believe that a registered gun that becomes a stolen gun would help in finding the thief or killer if that same criminal gets rid of the gun. Which, if later found, would then be traced back to the legitimate owner, who may not even know the gun had been stolen. The alibi better be outstanding!"
sarc,"Dear smiling, friendly, forgiving Archangel:  I would be quite happy to respond to you if you could organize your incoherent mental states into logical, debatable points.

As for my nom de Web, you have missed the point altogether. Either you are not quick on the uptake and/or you are completely ignorant of the Japanese language.

sarc,And we have an emotional post with no substance whatsoever. I'm sure your twin will be checking in soon. I think I'll keep a count of this type of post.

sarc,"And of course, the theory of gravity isn't ""physically"" proven either. Neither is the heliocentric theory or atomic theory or the germ theory of disease.

sarc,So did you read his mind to determine exactly why he bolded that particular set of words? You are the first mind reader I have encountered here.

(You do know what I'm talking about, don't you Calli? You do know what a ""point mutation"" is, don't you?) Bottom line is that there may be no intermediate between scales and feathers. A single point mutation produces feathers from scales. Various kinds of feathers require only further mutation."

sarc,"So if it's not human, we can kill it? But I dare say that's a different topic completely. Sorry, that was more along animal rights than abortion. Abortion is this for me: If the baby is going to endanger the mother's life as well as the baby, why endanger the baby and the mother? Sticking on the decided path, would you rather kill something you know is human, or something that you're not sure is human. It sounds a bit cruel and I didn't intend it to be that way at all.

sarc,"It's a look....ad hominem all you got? Evidently. Where's your picture at so we can make fun of you? What's the matter? A vasectomy got you shooting blanks? And by the way, if one of your cronies ""outed"" me, then he was no buddy of mine. Evidently, he is intimidated, also. You should hear how they talk about you at TPA. LOL."
sarc,Does it function better on tobacco? Alcohol? Caffine? How about hundereds and hundereds of different pills?

sarc,"Coveting is the basis for capitalism. Without coveting, there is no motivation!"
sarc,Nothing I have stated is incorrect. If I did you would get specific.
sarc,Do you have any New Testament passages to back these up - or were you just interested in having a rant?
sarc,World government is just around the bend! What shall we call it...The Company...The Authority...The End?
sarc,"So, if having children isn't a requirement fro marriage, then gays should be OK, right?   If it is what it is all about, if you marry a woman who is incapable of having children, even with scientific methods, then you are not really married?   What about lesbians? They can have childre, with a little help from the local sperm bank. In facst, they can BOTH get pregnant. Does tht mean that a marriage between 2 lesbians is twice as valid?   What if a couple of gay men adopt? Then is their marriage valid?   If I have a vasectomy, am I divorced?   You are confusing me. Please explain."
sarc,"Well....it was easier to get them to use those rather than the ones that just said ""White trash onboard""......."
sarc,"Just to be pedantic, a better analogy would be: ""If you are here, why do you have brothers and sisters?"""
sarc,"So if you quoted Ted Kennedy when he said to his wife in an event that wasn't even publicized ""Good morning, sweetie"", that would be an answer?"
sarc,Was your pretty graph supposed to convince me that the universe can't be understood? Perhaps I was to intuitively understand that you're right :p
sarc,More heretical misinformation from dear old cap0.   'Zionism is Racism' - a Dead Issue
sarc,That's it? That was your post? To attack a source without anything backing you up? Bravo!

sarc,"But on the other hand, Genesis isn't a scientific document. No wonder. Why would a bronze age nomad from the Levant be aware of at least 3 tailless species of primates, or even the tailed primates from Africa, South America, and even Madigascar. If they aren't mentioned in the Bible, do they exist?"
sarc,"Because the soundbite ""survival of the fittest"" was coined to explain evolution to the stupid masses."
sarc,Well if you are Catholic you would should probably find him pretty credible.
sarc,let's have an up or down vote on your marriage rights too Lurch.....
sarc,And irrational emotional appeals seldom hold up in the face of logic
sarc,"oh cc, apparently, 10% of the population has the power to destroy the other 90% somehow. We can't be in the military because we have the power to undermine things, we can't get married cause we will destroy marriage for everyone, we cannot possibly have committed relationships because it would make Britney look bad ( although, I have her beat by 4 years and counting, still happy and going) We have the power. We are gay, ten percent taking out the other 90% or so they say (ask jaaman for more info)"
sarc,"Yes yes yes. We know you are bigoted against any non-christian. I am sure that the out of context quotes are totally misrepresenting Islam. But, your out of context quotes totally misrepresent Judaism too.. so that is no surprise."
sarc,"It's sophomoric remarks like that that hurt the gay cause in America.   God isn't mocked, though. And I doubt the people are either.   And I'm glad California outlawed the sin. The only thing you have left is to hope the far left, spiritually-stunted judges in the US Supreme Court are pro Sodom and Gomorrah."

sarc,"Tell me then, does someone who is mentally retarded have a self-interest in staying alive? What about someone in a coma?"
sarc,I find it funny you think Article V was repealed yet the bill of rights references Article V for passage.   So we have the bill of rights which can't be repealed but Article V which was repealed meaning all the amendments we had are unconstitutional? You've really lost it haven't you.  
sarc,"Has the American Medical Association decided to recognize that aluminum, steel and polymer and addictive narcotic substances that can drastically alter a person's mental status?"
sarc,"Observations? Like the posts I have made? Which would be documented via quotes?....emoticonXConfused You demanded 'links' for your recurring rudeness, I produced them. I demand 'links' for my creationism."
sarc,"It's also hard to convince a rational person that something is so if there is zero evidence of its truth, but then you wouldn't have any clue about that."
sarc,I think we should not only allow GAYs to have legal marriage rights but also those who want to practice insist as well as all who want to practice polygamy. Let us not stop there let us sanction union between human and animals. After all I love my Dog and my Parrot. Why stop with GAYs?   By the way where does the term GAY come from for homosexuals.
sarc,Are you going to go and urinate on his grave as well?  My! My! What hatred and vitriol! What does it feel like to have so black a heart?
sarc,"have you considered a career in advertising?  by the way you f***ed us too. Australians troops were cannon fodder in WWI for the British Empire, remember Gallipoli?"

sarc,"Alexander, I don't give a rat's rectum about King James. emoticonXBanghead"
sarc,"No, actually, we don't.   I suppose it's pointless to ask someone who would speak for God to not tell me what I know."
sarc,O.K. lets' play your game. Gun control has worked exactly WHERE?
sarc,"I don't understand your outrage. McChrystal's your boy's general now. Are you saying that you disagree with ""the Great One""?"
sarc,It appears the safety Nazis feel gun free zones should be ran like prisons. Maybe the safety Nazis should take a field trip to their states prison system and ask the guards if guns or any other weapons ever make it into the prisons. Prisons are considered gun and drug free zones. If this was true then how can an inmate get shot by a gun in prison?
sarc,"Plenty. You haven't noticed how many ""sentences"" you post that aren't sentences?  "
sarc,"Nor is there any need for some mythical molecular elemental, nebulas natural selection, or mystical transitionals based on peicemeal forensics and antithestic rhetoric."
sarc,The egg is now a conscious human? In under 72-hours? Wow.
sarc,"You actually posted something that made good sense, and was funny too, maybe there hope for you yet."
sarc,point me toward the right way then? if creationists are wrong then why is evolution right? this is a biased answer based on your beliefs. please tell us how creationists were wrong. i would gladly like to see you try!
sarc,"And you, on the other hand, because you are not educated in science in general, and evolutionary theory (why the quotation marks?) specifically, are qualified to correct those of us who spent years in study of the topic."
sarc,John/John would figure out a way for the American taxpayers to foot the bill.
sarc,"You mean to tell me you would deny a life to be lived out and someone to get away with a harmful crime?? wow, sounds like a liberal to me.."
sarc,"Did you even notice that they were not the first to report it? Oh wait, you didn't because you are obviously using the fallacy of selective observation.  "
sarc,"All the more reason to be armed to the teeth huh,does this mean you see it our way?"
sarc,"No, think about what you just said. A cancer cell doesn't mutate, it attacks healthy cells and causes the destruction of healthy tissue. Kinda like liberals in a healthy society - they are the free radicals of the body politic, huh... go figure."
sarc,And Anarchy. Am I allowed to kill someone if I feel like it ?
sarc,"Sounds like an abortion bill amendment to restrict all travel by minors is needed by those demanding that young girls give birth after being impregnated by rapists, fathers, uncles, etc. Might as well include adults, just to simplify matters and enhance state police power. Bubbah will be pleased."
sarc,"For someone that knows how each side thinks, I would have thought you would have had an eye opening response that would have had me recanting everything I have said in the past and glorifying your name and everything you would say in the future, BUT, instead I got   "
sarc,  Now that is a diaper load. How's that free speech thing doing up there by the way.
sarc,I see. Sounds too nebulous to stand up to scrutiny in the US. I'm guessing that the SCOTUS would strike down such as law as being too vague.
sarc,Ahhh I see so God was more than willing to use extreme punishment for not loving your neighbor. Like how Sodom and Gomorrah were punished for not loving their neighbor.  
sarc,I guess the European union is a great failure? Is that why the Euro is trending 1.5 dollars as liberalism creats misery?
sarc,So now those that are opposed to even more laws on the books and a return to Old Testament practices are considered left wing? What's this world coming too? LOL
sarc,I was eight at the time. I'll read up and get back to you. Mind your manners.
sarc,Hmm.. does that include the Muslim Communities you were associated with too?.. We know as rational people that Denial is the Christians best weapon. You should seriously consider increasing your medications..   
sarc,"Yes but your one of those Christians people hear about, but never find. You don't really exist. :)"
sarc,"so you are into pommy bashing now? mae honey, is there anybody you don't like? emoticonXRolleyes"
sarc,So cross jurisdictional escort is a fairly common occurrence in the area. You will note that it is not the local cops talking about not being informed....it is the author of the article whining about it.
sarc,...Because everyone knows there are no married men sexually abusing children. emoticonXConfused
sarc,"Well, the pill has the ability to not let it implant, which ""God"" already cause for around 60% of its contemporaries. The pill doesn't destroy the ""entity"" at all."
sarc,"Oh.. that makes sense. Because, it sounds exactly like modern day republicans."
sarc,"But apparently they can't say no to renting the property for a gay wedding, even if they decide to just say 'no' to everyone and get out of business. go figure"
sarc,"Good to know that sence of humor hasn't completely evaded you.   Had me worried there for a moment, or two, or three... emoticonXWow"
sarc,"oh do tell us of this dooms day event, will we need new nike sneakers and $1.75 in our pocket when we all die?"
sarc,"Never heard of him...however, looks like those ever-loving proponents of free speech up in Canada showed Anne Coulter that 'free-speech' is Only what liberals make it to be....."
sarc,"Whose culture are we talking about, here?  I thought I was a member of the culture. What am I, chopped liver?"
sarc,"Well, good, I'm glad as heck you have a mom you can tell that to. Mine would've hit the roof, and then hit me on the way back down. Did she flip or was she pretty cool about it?  Just remember (who would we be if not preachy? Us ol' adults, we don't know nuthin') that b.c. isn't one hundred percent reliable or that condoms can break and you can still get nasty bugs all kinds of different ways."
sarc,So everything that other people say on a website or in a book is just and opinion? And everything you say is a fact? Nice how you've got things set up.
sarc,"It's also a noun. But since you're unable but to repeat your self, maybe a few more times will make it 'true'"
sarc,Good lesson! Always take the easy way out to try and avoid consequences of actions. Instead of leaving a note on a car saying you accidently hit you...you should just casually drive away. Thanks Simone!
sarc,Really? Can you link to a creationist website that does not connect evolution to people doing bad things?
sarc,And that would make you the one that IS advocating the murder of our future generation.
sarc,"No you don't cede that decision to her, Steeeve, you want to butt into her personal life and make her decision for her."
sarc,"Ready to condemn blind faith yet, jyoshu? Or are you going to stick to the argument that blind faith is fine so long as you can see you're not doing harm?"
sarc,"Umm, don't know about you but I also eject waste through my penis - just don't do it when having sex, just not polite (unless they ask, now there's another fetish I don't get). Isn't it odd if the anus was not designed for a penis its still pleasurable?  "
sarc,Hey don't insult Olberman... he looks good on the tube emoticonXGood lol....
sarc,You're out of your depth here kid. Go and clean your push-bike before you go out on your paper round....it's a disgrace!
sarc,"After all he isn't a cousin after all is he. You obviously are older than I thought or spent too much time around the DPC. Old joke? Q. 'where do cousins come from,' A. 'aunt holes'.   Darn J.P. and after all this time we spent together emoticonXHoho"
sarc,"Dear god.You really haven't a clue about what your talking about.Away with the birdies i think.Yousef was responsible for the 93 bombing,and he himself had very broad associations with some of the Al-Qaeda hardcore(Osama said he didn't know him and was in Sudan while Yousef stayed in Peshewer).Osama wasn't responsible for the 93 bombing,he wasn't responsible for Bali and Madrid and i don't care what the world media tells you.But by all means keep spouting your misinformation,i for one find it hilarious.  The Yousef-Osama-Saddam link is a conspiracy theory."
sarc,"And I didn't. Did you note how I explicitly put [Jesus said] for the first two quotes from the Bible, but not for the third one? Any idea why? Come on, think ... you can do it!"
sarc,"What, to be ""open-minded?"" or to embrace your definition of ""tolerance?"""
sarc,This coming from someone that is very choosy in the question that they answeremoticonXRolleyes

sarc,"What prompted this?  I guess I need to check what website I'm in...  Your response, Orion, (like trs) is that of a gutless, spineless, dip-wad. One who would tinkle in your drawers if you made such a claim while facing me. But, I've dealt with your sorry, trashy kind before and have found that no matter what is said, you'll act like you're ten foot tall and bulletproof.  But, carry on, Orion.

sarc,So you are happy that they chopped of the most sensitive part of your penis? That someone took and cut out a part of your body without your consent? What if it where your nipples? After all nipples on men serve no purpose.
sarc,"I'm with Smiley: you're describing yourself perfectly, save for referring to conservatives instead of liberals."
sarc,"That's deep.  Movement is not matter, I will use that the next time I decide to babble.  Are the particles no longer matter when there moving ?  Your funny."
sarc,"Looks like my first response to this was deleted? I'll risk it again since this post was not deleted.  Anyhoo,  This post just wreaks of the emotional and psychological development, maturity, morality, character, and integrity of SOME Republicans/Conservatives. emoticonXRolleyes   Waxy"
sarc,Of course it's solely a product of women's behavior simone. It's the women that has to make the phone call to the stork. The stork doesn't answer calls from men.
sarc,"I knew the mangling of Jesus's teachings would be forthcoming, and entertaining. emoticonXHoho   And of course lying about what I've said is just par for the course. Standard stuff, nothing to compare with trying to make Jesus out to be pro-cruelty."
sarc,Sounds like someone could be lying... hmmm who could it be? emoticonXIc
sarc,"My thoughts are my own, not from some 2000 year old Book that makes as much sense as a bag of Rocks. And I have only ever called anyone a name in response to an attack on me,   If you call what you have been doing debating then I see what the problem really is."
sarc,It might be telling that super heroes typically don't use firearms. That I'd prefer my crowds to have few if any guns concealed within hardly makes me pro-crime. Nor does it make me a pacifist. I'm a big fan of violence. The hands on kind.
sarc,Name them. Real contemporary people who testified about a real superman. And don't forget to identify the time period and where they lived and their written historical accounts.
sarc,Wow. I particularly like the part where you criticize someone for a lack of intelligence while making an elementary grammar mistake. It's you're not your.

sarc,"Or possibly your Holy Fathe has resorted to XXXXX-bashing. It's all perspective. Frankly, I don't think that the views on this message board will fuel discrimination and hatred of Popes everywhere around the world, so I think they have less to answer for."
sarc,"Again, you speak as if gays and lesbians are not worthy of their relationships being sacred to them. As if gays and lesbians are unable to hold dear any concept of commitment, loyalty, partnership.   What a sad and mean little man you are."
sarc,Pro-lifers are like slave traders? What a pro-lifers trading? Anyone who denies a human being a fundamental human right is a slave trader...like a right to life...???
sarc,I think that is true of so many things. Wanna screw something up royal? -- add humans.  I heard once that a gallon (or maybe is was a barrel) of Coca Cola (syrup) is more expensive than the same amount of oil. Things that make you go hmmm.

sarc,So it's your contention that hundreds of thousands of firearms stolen from residences annually is just par for the course?
sarc,Oh he won't read that... This American in exile (does not even live here anymore) just disappears for a while whe the heat is on only to resurface with his same propaganda after the heat has died down.
sarc,And Creationists who can't tell the difference between cats and nuclear reactors don't understand fluid mechanics.
sarc,So then will you go the way on liberty (repeal stoopid laws) or tyranny (enact more unconstitutional laws)?
sarc,"Archie, you have said so many incorrect things about evolution on this thread that it's hard to know where to begin. The idea that 'evolution teaches essentially that a fish walked out of the ocean and survived long enough to become a mammal 'springs readily to mind.  "

Not to mention that it proved the unintelligence of creationists (as well as their predictive abilities, which, I must say are very poor)."
sarc,"Crammed with them, sure, why not? It's easy, only a few million light years. The scientific method is used in weather forecasting too."
sarc,"Well, it does take some scientific knowledge to understand the evidence for evolution. One doesn't expect Creationists to possess it."

sarc,"No, we don't claim to know the truth. We gladly say ""we don't know"" to questions like ""why are we here"" instead of making up fairy tale answers just because we're too impatient to look for the truth. Tell us, do you still believe in the fire god and the tooth fairy too?"

sarc,So what are you proposing? Death panels? Do you think we should euthanase the elderly or should we simply stop their social security payments and healthcare?
sarc,"Unfortunately for you, that is not shown, the evidence points in one direction, and one direction only. That of evolution and to the fact that the flood never happened."
sarc,"You're right, why not simply kill these people in the shortest amount of time possible. I got it! We can advertise each killing (hanging, rock slaying, Guillotine, etc.) weeks in advance, kinda like moves, and show it on pay-per-view. You can buy tickets to watch the show live as well. I mean c'mon, if we're going to have the death penalty we might as well utilize in the most gruesome, cost efficient, and swift method possible. Right? That is how punishment was executed a few centuries ago.   Honestly, how you feel is how a lot of people culturally conceive such offenders. In regards to the death penalty debate, it falls along a continuum between morality and scientific reasoning."
sarc,"Oh that greatly changes the equation doesn't it? Very unrealistic, but for the sakes of the debate, why not? Well, alledgedly, 23 innocent people have been put to death, and for sure two unrefutable cases. I don't support killing people as a deterrent or as any means in a justice system."
sarc,According to Genesis? Why are you trying to present that as scientific evidence? Should I present The DaVinci Code as scientific evidence? How about Darwin's On the Origin of the Species?
sarc,Insects are not birds. Get your terminology correct. Also please stop lying. It makes baby jesus cry.   
sarc,"  How do you KNOW Bush let's Cheney run the government..oh yeah, that's right, CNN/CBS told you. So you will knock one of the greatest minds this country has because he has a bad heart and can't stand for long periods of time? What a goober, so I guess Stephen Hawking should die too, huh?  "
sarc,"god, this has been argued against a thousand times. by this deffinition masterbation is killing, menstration is involentary manslauter. by this deffinition you kill someone every time you walk by a carrot without eating it."
sarc,"Well, I guess you can refuse to see something that's pretty obvious. It's up to you."
sarc,"Yep, but those ""mixed views"" are slanted way left of center. A good offense always beats a good defense :) My guess is you are not very mature nor old? You out of high school yet?  "

sarc,"NAAAAA, actually it makes ME sound quite sane...I'm not denying a woman the ""right"" to have sex all she wants. THere ARE ways of having sex WITHOUT getting pregnant, I'm sure you'd agree. SO, it actually makes YOU sound like you are desperately hanging on to the ""right"" to take an innocent life just because you don't want to be inconvenienced. In Bizarro world, you might be right, but not in reality"

sarc,It's either that or he's a frustrated tenor for the Vienna Boys Choir. ;)
sarc,"Well, if you want to tell the truth, the theory of evolution is NOT a religion, it involves no magical deities, it takes nothing on faith. And since creation involves supernatural forces that are supported by absolutely NO evidence, it is not a scientific theory."
sarc,He was referring to the mimivirus which does NOT act like any other virus. Some of you people need to study a little harder :)

sarc,"You mental midgets insult my intelligence when you aren't even aware that the word omnibenevolent isn't even found in the Catholic Online - Catholic Encyclopedia . In fact, the word isn't found in any popular dictionary what so ever. It's an urban slang with no historical usage in theological studies or history at all. I ought to know, because it never came up in Bible College, ever. But here it is in the famous and highly referred to URBAN DICTIONARY: Urban Dictionary: omnibenevolent Once again guys, get a clue before you start spouting off your criticisms which you haven't an actual clue about."

sarc,Better a godly set of morals being crammed down your throats than the perverted gay sex hedonism of the devil himself.
sarc,i take by your redundant posts that you havent read the previous 20..
sarc,Having politicians monitor their ethics is much like having the mafia monitor crime.   
sarc,"This is not to say that every current dictionary includes such a definition... yet... but a number of major on-line ones demonstrably do, and to my knowledge human civilization has yet to suffer any negative effects.   (By the way, the above entries also include the typical ""husband and wife"" kind of arrangement as well. Funny how words can have more than one meaning, isn't it?)"
sarc,Just like Obama is? Really? Have you researched it at all?   
sarc,"Exactly, they are big on condeming the sins of those other guys. It makes them feel better about themselves. Also, it is always a good idea to have a vitriolic campaign about something that will never change so they will always have an enemy - homos are not going to disappear, abortion will never be made illegal. That's how the religious right recruits folks - get 'em all indignant about the ""others"" and they never notice they are being fleeced by the fat little pastor."
sarc,"I see -- in your opinion is it is ""illegitimate"", therefore it must be so. I think I trust the legal opinions of the courts more, but then, they do occasionally make mistakes. It's just not at all obvious they've made one in this instance."
sarc,"If you'd have taken the time to watch the movie ""Expelled"" you wouldn't find it nearly so absurd. emoticonXAngel"
sarc,"Don't worry, think everyone knows that your side doesn't have the sole monopoly on crazy.  "
sarc,So the fact that it is not legally recognized is the problem. What is the reason it's not legally recognized? Because the couple is gay.
sarc,"You still trying to push your propaganda film? Let me ask you something, why would the fetus try and avoid the forceps? An infant will cheerfully try and grip a knife that is about to end it's life."
sarc,"Actually, it is quite apparent that you do not. For one glaring example, below you incorrectly state that a dinosaur fossil has been dated by C-14. Another example of you lack of understanding of the topic is your failure to understand why very old fossils are found on the surface and the principles of dating from geologic strata."
sarc,So you'd ask on these issues even if you didn't know if they had signed it?
sarc,"Don't get your panties in a wad, 38 State Attorney Generals signed a brief in opposition to any gun control this clown can dream up."
sarc,That should get the natives milling around looking for victims. Fundamentalist Christianity does not take kindly to criticism.
sarc,This rates an 8 out of 10 on the hypocracy scale. Weren't you just scolding people both for using false analogies and for citing emotionally laden imagery for political purposes? Tsk tsk.
sarc,who knew? I wonder if I could have passed all those philosophy tests based on the philosophy I absorbed?  
sarc,"What exactly are the age ranges of these ""children"" in the news stories?"
sarc,"Hey that would be great. The law would FORCE all anti-gunners of military service age and ability to own a fully automatic rifle. The law would FORCE all anti-gunners to train with the weapon. The law would FORCE VOR to keep his rifle clean. Hey VOR how about it? Keep your rifle clean or go to jail. I'm not talking about my rifle, I'll be glad to keep my free government rifle clean. How about you?"
sarc,"There is the potential for a human that comes out of many, crude and vulgar things. Some end up on a maxi pad or when a guy reaches for the box of Kleenex. Should I feel a special bond with the conceptions rudely flushed out because they couldn't make it to the uterine wall? They had the potential, the DNA, were once a life too, and made a valiant effort. Life is constantly in motion. We don't value all life, or maybe not all life the same. When it appears to have some aspects of human personhood, this would seem like a logical marker, where we'd place greater value."
sarc,And I just spent all that money on a new camera. Pity.

sarc,"yea you've rebuttled every one of my posts with rhetoric. How do you explain how The Computational and Analytical Molecular Evolution Laboratory is calling for a new synthesis based on ""biased"" mutations??????   let's hear it."
sarc,"oh, it's obvious that non-darwinists have no affect on you guys. Nothing will ever change your mind because your mind is not made up on the evidence...it's made up on your worldview and your belief in materialism."
sarc,"So, am I looking for attention or am I mentally ill?"
sarc,"you told me in an earlier post that the mother should die, even if they predict the fetus will kill the mother. your bible states otherwise."

sarc,"Are you blind, or can't you read? NATO just provided evidence right now.  "
sarc,"You resort to the Bible, just in whatever way is convenient to what you want it to say. Just like fundies do. Zardoz, the problem is that when you play devil's advocate (which you like to do), you ONLY take a fundie approach toward the scriptures. In fact, you're often more fundamentalist in the way you approach scripture than fundamentalists. You'd make a good fundie, the best of them, I suppose."
sarc,So you think that ID is actually Christanity?   [quote]But in usual fashion you will claim it is me who doesn't understand when it is you who must corrupt the truth with the lies and distortions you tell.

notsarc,If you feed me a lot of caffinated coffee i start to wiggle and squirm too. I'm not really in any pain.
notsarc,"So you feel that Mrs Vo should have been allowed to run the risk of dying?      Your statement ""An abortion never has to be done"" only holds true if you place the value of the unborn child over that of the mother in all cases. Do you really believe that?"
notsarc,Really? I suspect that you have been duped by creationist ministers. There is no hype about Miller/Urey. It was an interesting experiment that demonstrated possibilities.
notsarc,"Actually, I don't have any respect for creationism in most of it's varied forms. I have had great respect for several individual creationists that I have met. But they earned that respect."
notsarc,"You know, this little phrase, ""minutes before birth,"" keeps popping up in reference to abortion.Could someone please explain to me the point of having an abortion ""minutes before birth""? What is the point?How many, if any, of this sort of abortion is performed?Could I get a really honest answer to that? Please, no lies.How many?Can anyone tell me?"
notsarc,"I don't know if we can be as accurate as a couple of million years, but I agree that the age of the earth is just right for supporting man."
notsarc,"uh, yeah, that was their intent! Under color of law no less. The truth always seems to be your worst enemy doesn't it?"
notsarc,"And if God was so against killing the unborn, why did he fail to make an exception for the pregnant women? If you alleged that the Biblical God is totally against killing the unborn, why did he tell him to kill all of the non-virgin women?I bet you won't answer the question and just rely on insults as an attempt to cover up your argumentative failures as you always do. See my signature for examples. "
notsarc,It has a chance. Any scientist has the opportunity to study ID. We are discussing the science classroom. We already teach it as a hypothesis in most schools. But it simply should not be taught as a valid alternative to evolution. That's what this debate is over.
notsarc,"Actually, I've heard it all before and it is wrong. The article is full of misinformation and misrepresentation. It is, as you say, slanted rather than an honest report of the data."
notsarc,"No, but in some cultures they mutilate them for meaningless tradition."
notsarc,"No, genesis is not a history lesson. It is a combination of 'just so' stories, and a religious message in allegory format. If you bothered to learn understand some of the hebrew puns behind many of the words, and also see the political commentary of events that were happening during the time it was written, that would be obvious."
notsarc,"Not at all, more stories that have been fed to you. The notion of a literal Genesis was rejected two hundred years ago, when no evidence of it could be found. the leading scientists of the day were often also trained in divinity, so they were looking HARD for it. But they had the integrity to admit that it wasn't there."
notsarc,"And Stephen Hawking, the only thing he has said was ""I do not believe in a personal god"", which would make him a pantheist or deist at best."
notsarc,"Your use of the word ""replace"" reveals your ignorance of evolution."
notsarc,"One reason for conversion is that they do practice many religions. Jesus said He is the only way to God. I believe that, so how can I just turn a blind eye when people follow so many different religions? I would not be following the commands of my Lord."
notsarc,"And how have I deprived you of your right to teach your religion to your children in your home and in your church. How does an objection against the imposition of your religion by force of the government deprive you of your rights. I can certainly see how the imposition of your religion would deprive me of my right to the free exercise of my own religion, but why do you feel that you have a right to impose your religion on me?"
notsarc,Except that the word for day in Genesis 1 is 'yom' and was understood to be a twenty-four hour day.
notsarc,The human collective is the authority. One major advantage of this authority over a theistic one is that it actually exists.
notsarc,"That's the standard dance. Victor Stenger didn't say it that way. On the back of his book, one review puts it this way;"
notsarc,"Ah, but the issue in this thread is what the fetus really means to anti-choicers/anti-lifers."
notsarc,"No I'm not Kronus. I haven't made excuses for him or denied what he did. OP said he is a conservative Christian which is a lie and I'm exposing that lie for what it is. Unless she can prove he is anything more than a conservative secular Republican, then he is no more a morally responsible person than an atheistic democrat. To attempt to mark all fundamental christians with the actions of this guy because he's a republican is a truly fallacious argument and a slanderous lie regarding me and all believers. None of this excuses what Vitter himself is responsible for doing. But she is wrong for immorally attempting to paint us all as adulterers because of his sin."
notsarc,"Actually, this data point is perfectly meaningless.NONE of the other information (or the conclusions) presented in this talk require ""26"".If we made it 260, does it change ANY of the other conclusions? No.A failure to recognize non-sequitur data tidbits is usually indicative of an argument that includes other errors."
notsarc,"Very true, especially since when someone asks ""is there a God"" they are most likely really asking ""does the God in which I believe exist"""
notsarc,Marriage is not a religious institution. It is a government contract nothing more. Many people choose to have a religious ceremony to celebrate their marriage but that doesnt make it a religious institution. Need proof? You can get married without the permission of the church but you cant get married without the permission of the government. And because marriage is a government institution then they cannot discriminate against same sex couples and must provide the same benefits to them as is provided to straight couples. And it cannot be a separate institution either because separate is not equal.   But as I have already said this shouldnt be up for a vote. Civil rights never should be.
notsarc,"See my post above, Hi. marc ignores fundamentals of Miller's beliefs that he clearly spells out in trying to push his anti-Miller argument."
notsarc,"WF, that is true and if the young lady life is endangered then to terminate the pregnancy would be appropriate but get a neutral doctor to make that decision, not one from Planned Parenthood or and abortion clinic who have a biased interest in performing abortions...............That is all I ask..........."
notsarc,I think the energy( essence of the human life) always was
notsarc,"Then why doesn't He answer prayers like He says He will in the Bible?   So is Jesus, aka God, a liar?   Or was not even one of the millions of believers who prayed for Terri Schiavo's life to be saved really God's child? Gee, I wonder how many people out there are being led by a pastor, priest, or what have you, that prayed but God didn't listen because that religious leader is a fraud? Hmmm, maybe the rape or molestation of young boys, adulty, and so on, by religious leaders is more widespread than anyone could have imagined?!?!?!"
notsarc,"Again, nonrandom is not the same as Lamarckian. Phenotypic variation can be nonrandom because the organisms can select the most attractive/successful mates with whom to breed. Once again, you're totally stuck on one aspect of the ToE, random mutation; the ToE is much more than that."
notsarc,"But recognition of the big bang as a very good explanation of cosmology isn't limited to evolutionsits. In fact, most other scientists also believe so, most especially cosmologists and astrophysicists, who are directly concerned with the early universe. Evolutionists, even though the origin of matter and time are irrelevant to the study of evolution, are also educated in science and probably accept the work done by these other scientists."
notsarc,Because it's a blatantly obvious fact of nature and intellectually honest experts in the field accept it.
notsarc,"oh don't kid yourself, you people were miserable long before I got here. Darwinists' arrogance is astounding."
notsarc,"No it doesn't!It cost way more money in appeals than it does to excute someone. WE the taxpayers pay for legal represenatation for them and us, plus the cost of keeping them in jail. The appelas process alone costs the tax payers millions.It is far more expensive to kill them than to leave them in jail with no chance of parole."
notsarc,"Actually, according to your use of the word ""person,"" she is. A significant percentage of fertilized eggs fail to implant and are instead passed. How sad (and typical) that you haven't bothered to educate yourself about these things."
notsarc,Who is to say that the guys teaching the geology know what they are teaching?
notsarc,"I don't believe Hell is a place either (or even if I believe in hell to begin with), but tell me more about what you mean by this. It sounds interesting."
notsarc,"Exactly. Most people would incorporate it, from childhood most often. Steeeeve can't seem to wrap his mind around that."
notsarc,"There is a point, however, that the fetal lung is not mature enough to survive outside the womb even with mechanical assistance. So, unless our technology will be pretty radically different in the future, it isn't about getting it out, it's about it not surviving when it is out."
notsarc,lets see im going to ask you some questions.are you ?are you a ? do you have blue eyes? do you have brown eyes? now if you say NO to one of those things isnt that cosidered an answer? where i come from its yes or no.2 possible answers. not just yes every time to get what you want.
notsarc,"Right. It was thrown out of schools back in the 1960s, and again in the 1980s when attempts were made to dress creationism up in the jargon of science and call it ""Creation science."""
notsarc,"Which, we suppose, in your mind releases the sperm donor of any responsibility whatsoever, right?Isn't it interesting that your solution for the abortion issue demands that women deny their sexuality while permitting men to run the gamut of theirs.Does this attitude, of which you are not the only proponent, stem from a hatred or a fear of women?"
notsarc,"Well, let's be honest here. People fear gay marriage, not that it might come about via judicial fiat. That's just the current whipping horse because that's how it happened first, for some broad values of judicial fiat of course. There was a recent post here about rights granted gays by their state legislature, Oregon I think, and a group jumped in and forced the law on hold via a petition drive. So it really isn't the means by which gays get equality that upsets some folks, it's the equality itself. ""judicial fiat"" is just a phrase people can use so they can avoid stating their true motives, preventing gays from being treated as equals."
notsarc,"Indeed. And that fact makes the old creationist plum about how evolutionary theory is dogmatic or that evolutionary biologists aren't allowed to disagree with ""standard"" theory a laugh. Clearly, evolutionary biologists disagree and those disagreements are published openly. Science makes progress by questioning and disagreement."
notsarc,"SNIPThis opinion piece was put forth by the Violence Policy Center, the same people who opposed all forms of firearms safety training and gun locks, because they might encourage people to feel that they're more capable of safely operation a firearm. The Violence Policy Center also pushed the idea of an ""assault weapons ban"" because it was easier than a handgun ban, claiming that the uneducated people are unable to tell what is a machine gun and what isn't a machine gun, making passage of such a law all the easier."
notsarc,"Yes, T. Kennedy is the alias of a known terrorist, and Ted Kennedy got punished because of it. And many are advocating that such a system be used to deny Second Amendment rights and be used to try innocent people in a court of law."
notsarc,"If a square is opposite to a circle (and it isn't, by the way), then gas/liquid/solid must be opposites therefore you contain opposites (by your own argument), in that you contain elements that are in these 'opposite' states. It's an argument I raised before, you said they weren't opposites, now you cite non-opposites! Why do you keep refuting previous arguments they YOU have made?"
notsarc,"Yea the legalizatioin of drugs would cause an epedimic of problems. Crime, suicide, mental health problems, and physical health problems."
notsarc,"Well, you didn't have my experiences, now did you? Each woman who has an abortion coul have innumerous circumstances and experiences."
notsarc,"Just so you know Peach, the 167 death row inmates are now serving life in prison. At least that one who's not guilty might now have a chance to be free."
notsarc,But the number of criminals that have firearms can be reduced. In developed nations that have very strict gun laws there are a lot less criminals obtaining and using guns to commit crimes. How does your theory explain that?
notsarc,"I never said anything about a conspiracy Peeling. I very clearly gave valid reasons to Consider that scientific GRANTS and pay increases for these scientists are based on making new and previously undiscovered claims that forward the science. That is the greatest motivation to lie, cheat, create and falsify evidence which adds to the scientists personal wealth and further promotes a false science that is rife with selfish motivations to preserve, protect and promote it."
notsarc,"'IF' is the question. It suggests that Holy Tradition does not know the answer.   Secondly, the issue of the flood itself could still be true and tested scientifically... as to whether an historical Noah existed that you might consign to 'myth'.   Does anyone here not find it interesting that there is almost a universal factor in societies concerning a global flood?   PS I have already discussed M-Eve on another post."
notsarc,You are incorrect when it comes to the age of the earth. All inidciation by all branches of science indicate an earth that is over 3 billion years old. (aside from the lies of the Young earth creationism. Each and every one of those 'indications' are based on misunderstandings and out right lies aboutscience. A discussion about the various methods (and where the YEC claims go wrong can be found at http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-age-of-earth.html
notsarc,"I am hardly a phyicist, but I am under the impression that there is at least some people who feel there is reason that there are 'uncaused causes'. I think thatthe terms used are 'Vacuum flucuations', and 'virtual particles'. I am not awareof any peer reviewed articles on it , but a popular press book is 'Achilles in the quantum world' by Richard Morris."
notsarc,"What the father wants is ultimately irrelevent.It's the woman's body that carries the fetus. It ultimately the woman's decision. As wrong as that may seem to you, it is the reality.If we, as a society, would just address the issue of unwanted pregnancies, then we, as a society, will resolve the isse of abortion."
notsarc,No. you're not making any sense. Where is symbiote? I got a horrible argument for him to dispell.
notsarc,"Why so many claims in opposition? I make a single claim, that can be refuted through logic, if it's fallacy. But the claim is correct.This new claim is an interesting one that I have seen others use. I'll tell you on what basis. Based on reason. To hold that nothing can be known for certain, is ultimately reduced to absurd unintelligble nonsense. I'll start a thread about this claim, it's a hot topic to be sure!"
notsarc,"Actually, qualified biologists know no such thing. In fact, I've never known one who would agree with that assertion. Can you give us some peer reviewed references to support your assertion?"
notsarc,"So parthenegenic births are always female. Where did the X chromosome come from? Is this another case of ""POOF, it was a miracle"" when faced with reality?"
notsarc,"Very well said, but remember, Evolution doesnt mean atheism, but creationism means religion. I know Christians that believe in evolution, but i dont know atheists that believe in creationism."
notsarc,"I fail to see where I broke any of those rules, no names were called, there was no labeling, there was no none of it. And even if there was, you do it all the time, so what makes you any different. Practice what you preach Penfold."
notsarc,"Those cultures that permit multiple wives at least do have issues as a result, but hard to say they fail miserably. We are complex animals and not all animals mate for life. There is significantly more involved in the lifelong union of humans than reproduction. Multi-marry under the right circumstances works, but it isn't for everybody and even for those that it is for doesn't mean it's for them always. In a nutshell marriage is the biggest commitment any person will make and should be given the consideration and thought it deserves. Same sex marriage can cause a perfect union of two people the same as M/F and can make a mockery or marriage just as many M/F unions currently do. The emotional investment is the same, the responsibility and obligations are the same, the only difference is genitalia and a little more hair in some cases."
notsarc,I see what she was saying now. When she said it it sounded like the man had no opinion at all.
notsarc,"No kidding. What could POSSIBLY be more concrete? As far as I can tell, she has never publicly made a statement specifically about the DC gun ban but since, as you pointed out, she DID say that no functioning democracy should allow private ownership of guns, I have trouble believing that she thinks the private citizens of DC should be allowed to own guns, UNLESS what she is saying is that since we own guns, we should move toward a monarchy or perhapse some kind of dictatorship. She did not, as far as I know, voice her opinion regarding private gun ownership in a totalitarian system."
notsarc,"And it doesn't stop there. Another of my favorites is how they loudly criticize radiometric dating (most commonly radiocarbon dating because they know no other kind) then shout from the rooftops that radiometric dating confirms the ""genuineness"" of ~2000 year old manuscripts..."
notsarc,"The 'teachings' either have no substance, or are certainly not original. Demonstrate categorically just who is the Son of God, and why this figure commands worship and obeisance."
notsarc,So we don't? I thought we had the capacity to destroy it. That seems within the range of control eh?
notsarc,"Actually, the process of fossilisation is not slow and can be done relatively quickly. All what you need is for sediments to quickly cover a dead (or an alive body - as what would have happened to Noah's Flood) and hence, fossilsation can occur rapidly; evolutionarly speaking, fossils take millions of years to fossilise a bone, but unless the bone is covered by sediments quickly, the bone will never fossilise. "
notsarc,I hope I have already begun to change your mind.
notsarc,So what? If somebody wants to die then they'll kill themselves no matter what.
notsarc,"Right. Please, reread your argument. Not to mention what Woodward actually said about Piltdown man. www.talkorigins.org"
notsarc,"This is why the title is ""God exists!!! (but he's not who you think he is). It's a funny proof which I don't think Christians would agree this definition was God. But basically it's saying that take the set of all human beings. Call the greatest God. God exists.Not only that, but the final conclusion is one of the premises. The proof is one big circle :)"
notsarc,That sounds like an honest answer. How did you feel about it at the time? How do you feel about it now? Just trying to educate myself more.   Huck
notsarc,"No, neither am I suggesting that illegality makes something immoral. Legality and morality are completely separate things."
notsarc,Well then it sounds like you don't even know what a SM is seeing as the 3rd one is the main one that people like you bring up when debating this isse.
notsarc,Abortion is their best choice?????? Yet women deserve better? Why do you think abortion is their best choice?
notsarc,"The same ones you've been told about, what, a few dozen times now? :)A small exerpt:"
notsarc,"We share a border with Mexico. The drug cartel is armed with missile and grenade launchers. But when was the last time 72 of our police officers were murdered on American soil, in a single day, at a single location?   The countries with the greatest number of legal gun ownership, they're absent these mass killings that take place on a regular basis. There's no rebels in America killing entire cities worth of people without opposition; not even in the small towns that're without a local police force.   Explain that one away."
notsarc,"Over 10,000 signatures of Christian Clergy have been collected, and have endorsed this letter."
notsarc,"How do you know he was a gun owner? Maybe he borrowed it. ;)And I bet he was a carnivore, walked upright and drove a car, as well."
notsarc,This isn't discrimination because the adult once did have have the right to live in a womb until it could live otherwise. Once out of the womb and living on his/her own this right has been exhausted because there is no need to be living in the womb. Much like you can drive but this 'right' is exhausted when you are drunk or too old to see anything.
notsarc,"True. Gallup couches the questions in a way that favors spiritualism. That is his preference and I think that his polls are slanted that way. I don't think I have ever seen a poll that actually asked the question directly and ""no religion"" doesn't really ask it. The numbers are just guesses. I think Big Orn is correct 7 to 10% is probably a bit low."
notsarc,"I know this would be somewhat of a drain on your time but I think it would be helpful if you would make a short post at the end of each post stating how much time the next poster has, what post number this is, how many are left, any comments concerning going outside the rules, etc."
notsarc,Why are you dishonest enough to claim that you aren't trying to get YEC into the schools.
notsarc,"deliberate acts of fabrication to produce false and fradulent claims as to what others have said. You cited my posts which did not imply anything of the sort you claimed it did and what I thought. In fact, some of the cited refute such claims."
notsarc,"There is some truth here. Did you ever see ""Independence Day""? They were taking pot-shots at the alien ships when they first arrived. It didn't stop the aliens... sure only a film... let's look at real life...modern - Iraq - Sadaam gave guns out to the people just before Gulf War IInot so modern - Boer War - Dutch farmers in South Africa were all excellent marksmen - Britain still invaded.US Civil War - I believe that the Confederate States were pretty well armed as far as the white citizens were concerned. US still invaded."
notsarc,"She could, but not all do :) Despite the fact that it works, there are still unwanted pregnancies :) That doesn't change the fact that a pregnancy would not be pleasant to a woman who does not want to be pregnant :)Forcing pregnancy by law is a step toward fascism."
notsarc,"Because of the history of it. Well, ID is actually identical to 'scientific creationism', but spruced up with more scientific terminology to attempt to pass 'seperation of church and state'. Let's just say that I.D. is an attempt to teach Creationism in school."
notsarc,"And if the ""natural process of evolution"" is determined by humans in a university lab, many with an atheist worldview, that clash with something the Bible says, you and Kenneth Miller immediately toss the Bible out and accept what the humans say - no questions asked?"
notsarc,"I think you might want to check your logic here... As far as I am aware, drug addicts cause a great deal of crime to support their habit. As you are, I am not terribly fond of policing someone's personal habits, but when drugs are the motivating force behind burglaries, assaults and muggings and addicts carry diseases such AIDS and tuberculosis then means of curtailing this should be explored. This may include policing or controlling the supply of drugs to an area to cut down and the amount of drugs sold, and thus less crime to support fewer habits.Easy access to drugs is, logically, part of the problem."
notsarc,"And how would Bush look if his own people hated him so much that they revolted? That would be very bad publicity, and quite an embarrassment that I wouldn't want as a country leader."
notsarc,"The logic we use to make statements about reality is derived from the way we observe material things behaving, and that logic is not immutable. Quantum physics demonstrates the fundamentally uncertain nature of reality at very tiny scales: the 'law of excluded middle' in particular taking it firmly in the shorts. Given that logic can vary on such a simple metric as physical scale, your argument is starting to look more than a bit frayed at the edges :)"
notsarc,"So,in your opinion,are you saying that this invading force that you are talking about,would never bat an eye as to whether the people of the USA are armed to the teeth or not in their pre-war planning?Surely any country that tried to overtake the USA would suffer severe damage to its military in all aspects.And even if it succeeded,it would still have to deal with our armed citizens.Are you trying to tell me that this is not a ditterent?Sure,if you dream up some DARTH VADER size invasion,no one stands a chance.But if you put it real world perspective.Say,2 or 3 of the bigger countries got together and decided to over take the USA.I would assume ""armed citizens"" would be a major factor in deciding whether to invade or not."
notsarc,Really? I don't think you know what you are talking about. Please provide evidence to back your claim. Thanks.
notsarc,"So was I. I did say I was playing devil's advocate. As far as I'm concerned, Tiktaalik is a triumph of scientific deduction."
notsarc,"No. Unless you wish to actually undertake the study of the relevant science, that's what you need to do. Creationists do the same thing. the problem is that creationists tend to accept the word of those who aren't any more educated than they are. Thus, a creationist will accept Hovind's dust on the moon argument or his shrinking sun argument as ""proof"" of a young earth."
notsarc,"As I mentioned above, science curriculums follow paths. One's worldview plays heavily on one's interpretation of scientific data. An agnostic, or atheist teaching establishment can become satisfied with one path of scientific theories without searching for others. There may be more to be discovered about thermodynamics, cell structure, irreducible complexity, the decay rate of the earth's magnetic field, radiometric dating, the fossil record, and countless other things that a teaching establishment may not be interested in exploring, if it's comfortable with it's interpretation of current data's indications that the happenstance origins worldview is correct. It goes back to what we touched on before - teaching students HOW to think, not WHAT to think."
notsarc,"Here's a question; which one split from the other? Which one is the ""new"" being? None of them are. If I get a cake and slice into two exact pieces, which one is the ""new"" slice? They are both equally new."
notsarc,That seems unlikely. He gets banned everywhere he goes with his multiple names. He's not very good at hiding his identity and not very good at controlling his temper when dealing with the sort of creation believing XXXXXX that you get frequenting these boards (I can't say I blame him on the latter point).Look around the web though and you will find him elsewhere...
notsarc,"As an aside I do admire your way with words, bravo!"
notsarc,"Yes that is a problem. But there is an instance when the 2nd Amendment did protect the USA from invaders:""Someone at the table asked a Japanese admiral why, with the Pacific Fleet devastated at Pearl Harbor and the mainland US forces in what Japan had to know was a pathetic state of unreadiness, Japan had not simply invaded the West Coast"" - http://www.backwoodshome.com/articles2/ayoob70.htmlIf it wasn't for the 2nd Amendment you would be speaking Japanese if you live on the West coast, German if you live on the East coast."
notsarc,"Sure. The outcome of Heller vs DC and Florida Shall - Issue laws support that statement. According to Brady logic, the more helpless you are, the safer you are from criminals."
notsarc,"Actually, at 24 weeks is when the the interconnection of the fetal brain begins. The nerve cells from the neocortex begin to synapse with the nerve cells of the thalamus. It is at this point that bursts of recognizable brain waves start to appear among the random signals that go on before. It is at this point that some scientists believe a fetus can feel pain as well.It is also at this point that a fetus can possibly survive outside of the womb (23-24 weeks), though the cance of survival is low and the risk of impairment very serious. This point probably won't change with technology either because the fetal lung is not mature enough until this point for even mechanical-assisted breathing."
notsarc,And yet there are plenty of websites written by scientists with the details:
notsarc,"What is a 'higher' species. If you mean a more intelligent primate?? The concept there is a hierarchy of 'higher' and 'lower' species is incorrect. Theonly difference between man and the other primates is that man has a hyperdeveloped brain. There are two sugars that are naturally produced by body by most mammals. When investingating the presnece of these chemicals, one of them is present in much lower concentrations in the brainsof all mammals. However, humans have a mutation that interrupted the production of this chemical. A piece of random junk got inserted into the middle of the gene that produces this chemical,and disabled it. Sometimes,evolution is not so much about what is added, but what is removed."
notsarc,"maybe firstly you should explain how god works? In what way does he manupilate matter in defience of the laws of physics, where does he dwell, how can we not observe such a being? And all the other questions of the supernatural. The theory of a god is actually a lot, lot more complicated than evolution as you have to explain *how* God works to get even basic science points."
notsarc,"Throw off our conclusions about what? I'm getting a bit confused as to what you're trying to cast doubt upon.Dark matter is stuff that doesn't interact via the electromagnetic force, so again by definition anything that we can't 'see' using EM waves is dark matter. this is an interesting article about one way we can observe it indirectly"
notsarc,"I see the similarity with the original scripture, in which Jesus was recognizing the authority of both God and Caesar in the world. However, Jesus was talking about the political power in the world. Jesus called the academics of his day, vipers and hypocrits, because they pretended to be holy but were evil. He called the wisest of men fools, because they did not believe in God. Also, as I stated before, truth should be the ultimate goal. I do not fear science. I do not see any truth that science may happen to reveal as a threat to faith. Why? Because God is Truth. Jesus said, ""And the truth shall set you free""!!! "
notsarc,It's not just cars and catalytic converters have greatly decreased emissions.
notsarc,"So, IOW, you are saying that those of us who are intelligent enough to realize that your non existent imaginary god doesn't exist have a chemical imbalance? Wow, that's quite a stretch even for you Archie baby."
notsarc,"Ill be the first to agree with the saying ""If you can...and have the place to...you will"" But like anything else..you have to look at the better side of things...It would act like a deterant to allow our responsable citizens to be armed..yes perhaps what you said might take place..but the benefits would outway them..and thats all we can ask for in life.As for our irresponsable citizens...they are already armed."
notsarc,Your wrong. Airplanes and courthouses are gun free zones but these places never have massacres.
notsarc,"Sure, but then you get into all sorts of problems of classifications, slippery slopes, and other awkward messes. Arguing whether an embryo or a fetus is a person seems to raise more trouble than it might solve. It seems better to err on the side of caution and devise a pro-choice argument that assumes the embryo or fetus to be a person rather than worry whether they are a person."
notsarc,"This is a separate issue, Voice of Reason. Some didn't understand how pro-choice people can say they personally wouldn't do something and/or think something is wrong but still support other's right to do it, and that's what I was answering."
notsarc,Tell this to those infants and adults in the netherlands who are being euthanized against their will. this is a logical conclusion of a quality of life ethic without a sanctity of life basis.
notsarc,"I think there are two separate questions here.(1) When does personhood begin?(2) Who gets to make such arbitrary, moral decisions on behalf of a pregnant woman?Both are legitimate issues of contention. You can't just dismiss the one you don't want to argue as unimportant. There are lots of excellent arguments going every which way, and many of them are objectively unresolvable, such as the one pertaining to the onset of personhood. They are truly matters of opinion.So, since there is obviously little agreement between people about when an egg and sperm become a person with full human rights, the practical question really is whose opinion matters most? The woman's, or the faceless bureaucrat's? emoticonXGood"
notsarc,"Kent Hovind is a slimy, uneducated, hack. His only education past high school is a degree from an unaccredited bible school. He is also a liar, since I just can't believe that anyone could be so stupid to say some of the things that he does. Of course, there are other people that are so stupid that they actually believe him."
notsarc,"And if you rewind a little over 40 years, the exact same thing could be said about interracial marriage.Archie's reply is a non-argument, and false at that.Multiple other groups state discrimination in marriage, but there are LEGITIMATE STATE INTERESTS prohibiting their marriage.Little things like child rape, lack of consent, and other issues."
notsarc,"It's quite obvious that it's the ID proponents who have issues with definitions, particularly among themselves. Behe has changed his own definition of IC, and Dembski changed Behe's definition of IC."
notsarc,I'm not surprised.   That's a typical response when someone calls your bluff.   Waxy
notsarc,"Because their axiom is that the bible is infallible, so any problems with reading it are the reader's fault, whereas yours is that contradiction implies error. What Ken's saying is that we can't draw a distinction between your axioms and those of a bible literalist in terms of which is 'right', because axioms are stated not proved: axioms define what is 'right'.To reiterate: his error is in forgetting that the universe operates according to its own axioms, whatever they may be, and we can judge whether or not our axioms are congruent."
notsarc,"But you haven't looked. You may claim that your god did it, and no evidence to support or deny that can be offered. The assertion relies on miracle and has no suporting evidence. But when you start talking about how your god did it, your claims can be debunked by facts. Certainly the mythology of ancient nomadic herdsmen is not accurate. If you look at the world and the history of the world the is evident in the geologic strata, then you can see that the earth is very old, and you can see a succession of organisms through time. When considered with other fields of science from genetics to biogeography to physiology and anatomy, evolution becomes apparent."
notsarc,Nobody should be forced to even have a sonagram. I think that you'll find reasonable pro-life and pro-abortion people believe that much.
notsarc,"What basis do fundamental rights derive from? In other words, how can we tell whether something is a fundamental human right?"
notsarc,"Now you're playing word games to confuse people. Page 11 of the Heller ruling stated that the definition of ""arms"" include all modern forms of bearable arms that're in common use. They didn't rule on machineguns because they weren't part of the case."
notsarc,"Well, I don't believe in evolution. I believe in things for which I have no evidence. And while it is true that everyone has bias, using correct science and the process of peer review works to eliminate. Not all is perfect, and people are people, but overall the system works. Not a lot of bad science gets through. In the case of ""creation science"" we know that there is no science involved. Only talk that sounds scientific. There is no hypothesis, prediction or testing. Only ad hoc stories constructed of selected bits of evidence to support the foregone conclusion."
notsarc,"**True, and the confusion was my bad, as explained already. However, the fact of revertant mutation in eusocial bacteria colonies, as demonstrated by Ames and by Cairns, still shoots great big holes in the darwinist assumptions arising out of your old war-horses, Luria & Delbruck '43, and its ""clone"", Lederberg and Lederberg '52."
notsarc,I believe you have even debated that it is conditioned into humans to be religious and therefore it validates religions. So why is there a need to debate whether animals love if they are acting on a conditioned response?
notsarc,"And yet you can offer nothing to show it's impossible! It most certainly is a plausible explaination! Fairytale?!? Don't think so, a logical path for the developement of the avian lung."
notsarc,"I see, when you say ""I'm not an expert"" do you mean you aren't a climate scientist or do you mean you don't have the scientific knowledge to discuss this?"
notsarc,"That's NOT the equivalent of ID - you're mixing causes & effects. The theory of evolution, and the theory of intelligent design would equally observe, measure, and publish the effects of the apple falling. Then the evolutionists would say that happenstance origins caused gravity to work that way, and ID proponents would say that a supernatural design caused gravity to work that way. Students shouldn't have it implied to them that happenstance origins are the only possible cause of gravitational behavior. Your ""apple falling"" scenario is a simple one - the original cause of gravity has practically no impact on how we observe and deal with it's effects. Other scientific subjects aren't that simple. "
notsarc,"And you've been failing miserably, partly because your definition of ""atheism"" is asinine. Even most Christians would disagree with you."
notsarc,"The concept that science no longer looks at animals boggles my mind. My brother is a wildlife biology major in college meaning his primary focus is......looking at animals and their relationships to one another. It is somewhat understandable that your misconception could arise because molecular biology and genetic engineering are the latest crazes in science. The simple fact is most of the big breakthroughs when studying whole animals have been made. A similar turn has occured in chemistry. I could argue that chemists have subtly turned away from chemical reactions. All the research now is about electron orbitals and nano-structures. The reason for this is these are new fields that are relatively young and many scientists are interested in them. I myself am doing research on buckminster fullerenes. It doesn't mean we've abandoned good old fashioned reactions, we just have more field to play in now."
notsarc,"Really? Why? Bacteria don't need to see to exist. They don't depend on light to live. In fact, bacteria thrive in dark, moist areas. Why would natural selection determine this ability as being advantageous? If populations of bacteria with the ability to sense light are ""better suited"" than other bacteria, how many different types of light-sensing bacteria are there? "
notsarc,I know it's almost as silly as thinking gay marriage will undermine heterosexual marriage.
notsarc,my my you are up on the current events. Thanks for shedding light on this for everyone here.
notsarc,"Here is what fascinates me about the judgmental criticism you offer of my opinion. In typical fashion you make claims which you don't support at all. Here is my post below, point out WITH EVIDENCE!!! what I am distorting in any way; especially that which I hold dear. In other words, write a cogent and rational post which makes sense when applied to the quoted post it intends to attack. emoticonXDonno"
notsarc,"Really Brady. It is widely recognized that Mr. Heston gave away a very promising film career in order to take such an unpopular stand at that time. In fact he worked very little in films after that. I think the above statement was a political one, an anti-gun one, without much fact to back it up.I don't think a man of such principle changes his mind when all he actually work to accomplish comes to pass. But you can push your poison just as far as you want to. You have a first Amendment right to do so. Mr. Heston would have wanted it that way!"
notsarc,"Actually, there is no such thing as ""an evolutionary mutation of a gene."" A mutation is a mutation. For evolution to have occurred requires neither that a mutation be new nor useful and they don't require new structures nor structures.Here's a little mental exercise for you. At most, a person can have only two alleles for any gene. This would have been the condition of the human race 6,000 years ago according to creationists. It would not have been possible for there to be more than 2 alleles for any given gene. Now consider that for every gene in the human genome there is an average of 14 different alleles, sometimes more, sometimes less. Where did all of those alleles come from?"
notsarc,"But if the repeated tests just confirm the same errors or misinterpretations of the results, all of the independent reviews in the World wont make a difference."
notsarc,"Actually, I pulled the number out of the air for illustrative purposes only, but after reading the CBO report, I see that I wasn't far off. They predicted 600,000 gay couples would want to get married it allowed."
notsarc,"So every woman who has an abortion lives an irresponsible life. Care to give any examples, or are you just spouting rubbish with no experience or knowledge whatsoever?"
notsarc,"So you know how foolish you are and hope that name calling will distract from that being recognized by everyone. Erectus skulls were smaller because the brain was smaller. You brought up KNM-WT 15000 (Turkana Boy) and you weren't even aware that as an adult he would have been about 6'1"" tall? Why is his skull smaller than modern humans?"
notsarc,"You could've just as easily revived the last thread, commenting on how the antis are unusually silent."
notsarc,"Because Apes, monkeys and chimps are on different paths. You wouldn't expect a shark to evolve into a barracuda-like animal. things evolve to fill niches, we currently fill a niche, there is nothing pushing apes, chimps or other primates to fill a niche that is occupied. "
notsarc,"But a slightly larger brain than average is still feasible and offers enough of a benefit in a large social group that its worth the price - however something the size of a modern humans brain is far too demanding. That slightly larger brain can be supported by an organism or society that hasn't developed fire, but is also able to discover the uses of it, from then on nutrician isn't the big limiting factor that restricts how big a brain can get from then on. "
notsarc,"Well regulated as in the second amendment does not mean regulated by the government, it means well equiped and prepared. The framers of the constitution often spoke of a tyrannical government and how to keep one from coming to power, so why in the hell would they have said lets just give the government total control of guns. Your definition of well regulated makes about as much sense as adding another day to the week."
notsarc,"Well, since you have natural selection completely wrong, it must not go too well with the Biblical account. By the way, now you have introduced another word that has no meaning in the context. What is a ""kind."" Please be specific so that I will be able to recognize a ""kind."" Please show why a ""kind"" only has the ability to lose information."
notsarc,And that is different how? I told johnny to write that I'm infallible. Therefore the book that I told johnny to write proves I'm infallible. There is no difference.   You do realize that there are other religions out there? That science is constantly updating?   Your arguments have been nothing more then false dichotomies assuming there are only two choices despite history laughing in your face.
notsarc,"It's the first couple of paragraghs from the article in this weeks NS. If you had an online subscription or got a copy from your newsagent you could read the whole thing, unfortunately with this one the intro rambles on a bit and doesn't get to the point till the second column..."
notsarc,"See above. Whether a couple is or isn't monogomous is not for you to determine or worry about. And speak for yourself if you don't mind. This member of the American public's mental health is just fine thank you very much. If gay marriage impacts YOU that much, well that sounds like your problem."
notsarc,"Nice raising the bar. Fallacies are a creationist's best friend. You claimed:""have never shown to add any new structure or even a new part to any existing structure.""Now you are changing your argument away from structure as new proteins and especially enzymes (which are proteins) don't count."
notsarc,"No! At conception we are a person and human.All living things belong to a species and the foetus is a living thing, for that reason a foetus must belong to a species, and that species is human.A fingernail is dead so cannot be considered a living human, nor will it develop into a human.The sperm only has half the chromosomes so is not human.The unique human is the key element here, if you cut your nail, the DNA from the nail can be replicated by the living persons nail, a foetus when destroyed cannot have itself replicated, the unique DNA that is destroyed will never be see on earth again, that individual has gone forever, howver, the man with the nail clipped is still alive."
notsarc,"True, they can change laws if the are unconstitutional. So what makes a ban on abortion unconstitutional?   Also, what makes the dealth penalty for minors constitutional one day and not the next? In fact 15yrs ago it wasn't an unconstitutional decision. I guess now it is??? Makes no sense.   Clive14,   those are obviously not my beliefs as I think everyone is equal.   I am not sure your wealth makes you different from someone else. It means you wealth is unequal..we are talking about just people. We all end up 6 foot under (so to speak) in the end."
notsarc,"I think this is a bad way to put it...the evidence that they earth has been warming since we have had the ability to measure temperature is overwhelming...the cause is unknown and whether or not it is natural is unknown. It does seem fairly narasistic to think in 100 years we have caused so much damage to an earth that at least has been here 10,000 years."
notsarc,"Possibly, depends on what you read and by whom. Still, the war wasn't aganist slavery."
notsarc,"Heart bypass, prostate cancer.......I have a couple of Canadian friends who needed those surgeries and one was told he had a 4 month wait and the other a 6 month wait so they both came down to Bellingham Wash and had the Surgery within 2 weeks............"
notsarc,I never said they would actually follow it all the time. I said that most would incorporate it (referring to a world morality). Just because they would accept it doesn't mean they would follow it. Maybe you should stop trying to tear down your little strawmen.
notsarc,"I see your point, Iangb but I'm not about to be leaving before you've had a chance to respond. I won't be ""leaving"" at all. You challenged me to produce an argument, so I'm going to produce my argument. I will then summarize the argument, and you can respond to it and we can then discuss / debate those specifics that you have a problem with.Truthfully, this is how I should have first responded to your challenge. Doing it piece meal has only resulted in a less focused debate.--Chuz"
notsarc,"Yes, it is, and I'll gladly excuse his grammar compared to my zero ability in Hungarian."
notsarc,"Because self-defence, unlike most other 'reasons', automatically allows all citizens firearm access, and in most cases allows firearm acess without mandatory training/evaluation. When this occurs, you are much more likely to get misuse of firearms.If you read around you'll see that I consider all rights as needing justification. This comes both from my stance as a relativist and as a UK citizen, where there is no formalised Constitution. Ask yourself this - if a right cannot be justified, why should it be treated as a 'right'?"
notsarc,"people keep saying thats the law in texas,so Im saying that this is the law in New York,He broke the law so he had it coming,next time dont disrespect the law and get a license,Im just showing how some of the people on this board are major hypocrites,you suddenly get all soft on crime when you dont like the law,"
notsarc,"But the responsibility does not end with the woman who experiences the pregnancy. If it did, then men would not be required by law to pay child support."
notsarc,"You lie. You keep saying the same things over and over again, that doesn't make them true. Your addiction to violence is showing.Tony Martin shot an unarmed 16 year old kid in the back as he was running away. That's not self-defence, that's cold blooded murder.It is not the role of individuals to exact revenge for crimes committed against them. You don't get to take the law into your own hands. Munir Hussain ran after the intruders and beat them up with a cricket bat in the street. That's not self-defence, that's revenge."
notsarc,I disagree for the same reasons I have been giving all along. There may be some legislation that was passed that has kept corporations small (Anti-trust) but did it really benefit the society?
notsarc,"True, but I was referring to psychological explanations, not genuine reasons."
notsarc,"I don't see how this is not a debate about abortion. True, it's become mildly less concrete, but that's what happens when you try to get it right."
notsarc,actually they probably drifted much faster than that.....probably upon a pole reversal.
notsarc,"Well, it seems to me that if you have a reflex it means you have an at least partially developed and functional nervous system which would tell me that you can feel pain."
notsarc,If you truly believe this then I think you need to re-read your posts and put yourself in the shoes of those on the receiving end. 
notsarc,"So, this statement is from a 'law center' that is dedicated to defend the religious freedom for CHristians. Yet, this isn't about 'religion'. Why do I find that hypocritical."
notsarc,You don't even take into consideration the possibility that Japan could have a higher mass murder rate- perhaps the same as the US- if guns were freely available in that country. You have a lot of explaining to do if you expect me to buy what you're trying to peddle. 
notsarc,Really? The transcript shows that he did not ask her anything in the Gay marriage section of the discussion.Transcript can be found here: http://elections.nytimes.com/2008/pr...al-debate.htmland here: http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/...ipt/index.html (click on the same-sex benefits section and the transcript shows up right next to the video)
notsarc,"well yes that's what he did, but he did not try to present this as positive evidence for anything. the biomorphs were used to illustrate the point that random mutations are much more likely to produce beneficial results when the mutations are small. analogies always break down at some level, this analogy was used to illustrate a certain point. the assertion that dawkins was suggesting that a biomorph happening to look like a real life object were proof that evolution and natural selection could produce such creatures is false. montalban, to restore integrity i suggest you retract the conclusion you drew from snippets and quotes from dawkins as your paraphrasing was clearly not representative of dawkins' ideas."
notsarc,I think you're mixing up socialist and fascist. Patriotism is anathema to socialism.
notsarc,"Yes, to follow his commandments to love God and to love one another."
notsarc,"There is a pretty huge difference.Civil unions aren't nationally recognized, for one thing, since not every state has them. If you travel to a state that does not offer civil unions, then your union is not valid there.I think there's a problem with dissolving those unions as well.The big difference, though, are the rights that these unions provide. There are over 1,000 legal protections and rights that marriage provides that civil unions don't. I'll try and find a list of differences."
notsarc,Pretty good considering Darwin wasn't aware of genetics. Too bad Wells is stuck in 1859. The modern synthesis provides perfectly legitimate mechanisms.
notsarc,"HA wouldnt you say someone who is really overweight actually has more of a problem with stress on their joints, muscels, heart, and bladder than a woman carrying a small child in her womb? Obesity can demand major scarifices in behavior and diet. Some of which can be detrimental.I really dont see your point because this isnt just a woman's problem when it comes to these issues you pointed out.And im not really sure what a ""pregnancy"" is according to you.. please explain.. When i hear the word pregnant, i think of 2 people, not just 1.Also, the baby has its own blood, its own immune system, and contains its own calories once consumed. theres nothing that the mother has that the baby doesnt other than it just needs nutrtion. Just like you need food everyday."

notsarc,Butwhat of the fetus/babies that were wanted by daddy but not by mummy what does termination stop then?
notsarc,Well I'm glad its no problem for your son. No child deserves to be harrassed.
notsarc,"This is more of a legal question involving whether or not it was negligence(sp). If so, you can't really sue for amounts of money you MIGHT get in the future. He could sue for lost pay on the job and other medicial procedures. So ya know :). I don't really know what the question is."
notsarc,"So you're saying that the theory of evolution is similar to ####, in that they both make large messes when they come into contact with fans?"
notsarc,"Yes, because its THEIR decision, its THEIR stomachs, and its THEIR lives. I agree that some decisions do need to be made with parental consent, but not this one.   Irrelevant. How does purchasing a house have to do with abortion?   Ok, so what if the kid wants to have the baby and the adults want to get rid of it? What if the adults want her to have the baby and the kid wants to get rid of it? You would force the kid to have a child (that doesn't seem responsible at all), or you would force the kid to abort her child (thereby taking away her son or daughter). Both of those decisions don't sound very consitent or responsible. The decision is best left up to the person that is pregnant, regardless of their age."
notsarc,"Actually you are incorrect. The most commonly used rifles on the competition circuit are so-called ""assault weapons"".The ""assault weapon"" moniker is a term just recently fashioned to describe a military looking weapon.There are several target competitions designed solely for these types of rifles."
notsarc,"Yes, the Byzantines are a Catholic Rite. The Catholic Church is divided into rites- there are seven I believe, the Roman, of course, being the largest. The Byzantine Catholics are an Eastern Catholic Rite, and as you said are almost identicle to the Orthodox Churches except that they acknowledge the Pope as the head of the Church.East to West, a website regarding all the churches of the Catholic Church, especially those of the east.Real quick, the Orthodox acknowledge the Pope as the successor of Peter, but not as the head of the Church. Am I correct?"

notsarc,"From my first post, starting with the quote from the religioustolerance website;"
notsarc,And folks that refuse to see the legitimate ones put us all at risk. Touche.
notsarc,"Yes. It's not logical to simply cite, ""the Bible tells me so, the Bible was written by God,"" and consider that an argument. The Bible has been wrong. It's also not logical to cite authority to God. It necessarily begs further questions about your God's unproven existence to those who don't believe in that God, or in any God. If we don't simply believe in your God, on the basis of your presupposition, he can have no authority over the rest of us. One must come up with another argument.Should each religion have it's own definition or completely different idea of logic, which favours that religion and its God? "
notsarc,"""He"" is real to all of us fjp, whether we acknowledge Him or not, God is alive and well on Planet Earth. And the day comes for each man when he faces that reality. For some of us it's a long awaited day of joy and for others a long dreaded day. But believe me when I tell you that just because one denies that God exists, it does nothing to lessen His reality."
notsarc,"No it doesn't. First, the changes may not be neutral. I will presume that you are intelligent enough to grasp that idea the mutations in and of themselves are neither advantagous nor disadvantageous, and the they have no purpose. Evolution happens when the mutations (and other mechanisms that increase genetic diversity) are acted upon by other mechanisms of evolution. Even in natural selection there is no purpose. Natural selection is differential reproductive success. Some organisms tend to produce more offspring because they have characteristics that give them an advantage in a particular environment."
notsarc,so we would penalize financially those who want to have kids?
notsarc,"If your friend is hearing voices in her head to walk into traffic, she needs some psychiatric help."
notsarc,Being in the minority or in the majority is irrelevant. Belief has no bearing on reality.
notsarc,"Yes, it is very hard, even for theologians, to explain."
notsarc,Actually the details of HOW embryogenesis proceeds is becoming increasingly understood. And it goes way the heck beyond speculation. Check out how homeobox genes work and how regulation by master switches is understood as just two examples.
notsarc,"Why would that even be expected? When you consider that it is important to maintain some sort of consistency in study populations, obvious mutants are excluded from the breeding stock. And yet, there are frequent observed mutations. In fact, my elder son once observed two mutations in a single fly in one of his populations. One fly had no wings and white eyes."
notsarc,I'm not arguing that gun control will change the nature of men- though guns may make them more willing and confident to engage in crime. With guns criminals can do even more damage. Adding guns to crime is like adding gasoline to a fire- it makes an already existing problem worse. If you think that just as many people die from stabbing and beatings in other developed nations as people die from guns in the US then you need to do more research.
notsarc,"Its amazing how the facts are in front of thier faces yet they still claim they are only for ""Reasonable"" gin control laws."
notsarc,"I do not argue so much the quality of llife of an individual woman but more for the quality of life, indeed of having access to life itself, of the children of the woman involved, because in many situations the concern and nurturance of a mother may be the only thing keeping children alive, especially in poor, war-torn nations that do not enjoy the relative wealth of the United States."
notsarc,"Interesting, but it appears to ignore the fact that there is pre-existing variation (just look at the pictures). Emphasizing mutations is ok, but relying solely on them will probably skew results."
notsarc,"There are in place control procedures for traveling with weapons. All he should be charged with, and I expect he will before this is tried in court is breaking the Airport procedures, or maybe they are FAA procedures which could imply Federal laws.   This guy should have contacted the Airport at check in to report each and every weapon he was traveling with. They would have advised him precisely how to store them and he wouldn't have had any issues at all. Here's the FAA Regs for traveling what is and isn't allowed. I must say that I'm somewhat alarmed at some of what is allowed if I put my terrorist thinking cap on. FAA News"
notsarc,"You know Brady, you've said a lot of stupid stuff over the years. I even remember finding a post of yours where you said all guns and gun owners should be registered, but sex offenders shouldn't be. This latest post of yours is just another senseless and stupid rambling of somebody that's so hateful and fearful of an inanimate object that it's impossible for him to function in our society and can barely handle his own needs."
notsarc,"I think some people will and have argued that. I'll work on finding a quote, but I believe it was somebody here who argued that, because of the recent SCotUS ruling, home invasion in DC would decrease because criminals would be more worried about encountering a homeowner with a gun. You do have a point about preventing a worse crime from occuring,though."
notsarc,Nothing.... they both have to live with the shame of killing their baby.
notsarc,"No, Creationism is the specific idea that the creation story in Genesis is literally true (creation ex nihilo, direct creation of organisms, global flood, etc). It is false."
notsarc,...and 8 beers are imo worse than one joint. People tend not to smoke as many 'doses' of pot as they drink 'doses' of alcohol.
notsarc,And my interpretation of my writing is that I didn't mean that. Who has more authority?
notsarc,"It is worse then that they just don't get it. Once you put some civil rights on the ballot nothing is off limits. Freedom of speech, religion, assembly ect.. they are all up to be voted out of existence for an unpopular minority by the majority. They just don't get it."
notsarc,I'm not sure that your comment will encourage any sort of discussion. Certainly no one is glad because your mother died so young. Not even creationists are likely to be gleeful.
notsarc,"Because if evolution cannot explain all changes it is false, Unless you propose some creatures evolved and some were specially created. Is that what you mean?Genesis says that all creatures were specially created. It fits with the observational evidence but there is no smoking gun that proves it.Statis is the norm not the exception.One is right the other wrong. It cannot be both ways.Do you have an answer to how a lizard can morph into a bird considering the amazing difference in the lungs?"
notsarc,Pregnancy is a health issue only for the woman. Your glib remark pretending to sympathy is insulting.
notsarc,"IF! But here's the thing, Mexico is making absolutely no attempt to truly stomp out the drug cartels, they're catering to them!

After all, they are the biggest retailer in my area."

notsarc,"Humans are about the furthest thing from perfect. The bible IS perfect, it's flawless. You can't take anything from it and prove it to be incorrect. The only thing that even comes close is misinterpretations of certain sentences. I know plenty of people who don't believe in any sort of God and aren't bothered by the thought that this is all they have, the only life they'll ever live. Maybe some people need to believe in more to live more, but all people don't."
notsarc,"Yes, but we do not know that homosexuality is not inherited, and it is the arguments like this that make people want to prove that homosexuality is genetic. Also, people born infertile cannot reproduce, so are those people inferior in a relationship because of what they cannot do?"
notsarc,"And religion is what caused the Crusades and most other wars in the past, and many wars, and bloody disputes, to this very day. Many, many, many, many, many more people have died in the name of religion than in anything that could be called ""in the name of atheism""."
notsarc,"Incorrectly by those who don't understand evolution. Talking about the evolutionist theories about the big bang is pretty mindless, since the big bang is cosmology. Whether or not there was or was not a big bang is irrelevant to evolutionary biology. Lumping other sciences under ""evolution"" is a method of creationists so that they can claim that they don't oppose ""science"" but only evolution. To be a creationist is to reject the last 400 years of science - cosmology, astronomy, astrophysics, nuclear physics, geology, paleontology, tectonics, biogeography, genetics, population genetics, and so on. You get the idea."
notsarc,Life evolved over billions of years rather than being created in a few days.
notsarc,"People have entertained and will always continue to entertain beliefs in all manner of propositions. Many people once believed that the earth is flat:perhaps some still do. But this has nothing to do with scientific truth.There is no ""version"" of science that one chooses from a menu of possibilities.By definition, scientific enquiry arrives at hypotheses after gathering evidence from observations and experiment. Any law, knowledge, etc. thatis arrived at by scientific method is open to modification or falsification if new evidence comes to light that must be taken into account. All science in this sense is provisional.The apostles may have believed that Jesus walked on water: that does NOTmake it true."
notsarc,"It's thanks to the opposers of the theory that all this rubbish about descending from monkeys and slimeball came about, all ppl need is a bit more education and things should become clearer."
notsarc,And what if it is one to me? Then your refute is equally refuted. The support for us not knowing lies in you and other's inability to provide anything beyond speculation as support for the assertion that an unborn child is not a person. Your own inability is my support.
notsarc,They can if they're Catholics since Evolution is accepted doctrine now in the Church.
notsarc,"Well, this gets rather complicated. A very young child does not get to choose his or her adoptive parents. Who decides on who adopts whom depends on the kind of adoption and the policies of the particular adoption system. In private domestic adoption, the birth mother usually gets to decide on who will adopt her baby. The foster care system is organized differently, and international adoption is different still and depends on the country from which the child is being adopted. So it's pretty much impossible to generalize about adoption policies and practices. They vary greatly.The point is that the purpose of adoption is to protect the rights of the child."
notsarc,I see I jumped the gun. That was well stated.
notsarc,"Chloe, the point of this thread is to help you understand what the argument is, not to give analogies to abortion."
notsarc,"And what would make them separate species? How about wolves and dogs, separate species? How about Great Danes and Chihuahuas? They cannot interbreed under any circumstances (even artificially - the fetus isn't viable)."

notsarc,"Actually both are relative in every situation. Especially ""The Truth"" as espoused by religious fundamentalists such as yourself, as there are as many different versions of the truth as there religious fundamentalists."
notsarc,The majority of criminals don't want to deal with trouble. Most aren't looking for a shootout where there's a risk of them getting shot at and most don't even want to shoot period. Most are just looking for the free stuff they can get or in cases of rape they're definately not looking to fight an armed victim. It has been shown that criminals are less likely to break into a house whose owner has a gun.
notsarc,"Well, I did say I was being nit-picky: all I was objecting to was the way the original wording suggested that the change was occurring in order to avoid competition. Assuming it was due to selection, the competition from the larger birds was the putative agent of that selection.(Incidentally, I suspect we live on the same side of the Atlantic.)"
notsarc,And the loss to society because people used guns instead of an alternate weapon is?
notsarc,"The US is still the closest thing to a pure capitalist country in the world. But you are correct, our system is not a pure capitalist one. We have reminants of all types of systems including socialism. In the modern world I don't think a society as large as the US is could be run under just one pure system."
notsarc,"Just to contribute, I'm pro-gun, have had training in the proper use and laws in my area, and have owned weapons for more than 30 years."
notsarc,"the reason why premise 1 can logically stand is that God is first of all defined as the ""greatest possible being"". no matter what reality we are considering, such a thing as the greatest possible being in that relity must exist. ""greatest"" is a superlative, compared to all other beings that existits like ""the oldest man alive"". no matter what scenario, such a person as the oldest man alive will always exist, therefore such a man (that fits that definition) will have a necessary existence"
notsarc,"Would you mind telling us just how he determined ALL maladaptive or inconsequential mutations in his test organism and just how he validated such measurements? To me as a biologist with quite a bit of microbiology under the belt it would seem to be impossible to do so! After all its very likely that a fairly large portion of the populutaion will have at least one mutation at at least one base pair location in the total sequence! Your claim would seem to be impossible, but perhaps there is a way he managed to do so."
notsarc,"here we go Dan. your problem with the law is not whether its fair or not, its whether you can benefit personally from it. you have no problem with abortion because your not going to be the victim of such a law, but youd definitely have a problem if you were the one suffering from the law. Apparently you dont care if the law disadvantages or is unfair to others, as long as it doesn't hurt you, you're OK with it."
notsarc,So? The point was that people who support gun control are not necessarily communists.
notsarc,I see. Then you are attempting to define evolution out of existance. By your definition (not that of evolutionary biologists) evolution requires an increase in information. An unsupported creationist argument. Define information in a meaningful way. Please apply your definition to genetics and show why all genetic changes are a decrease in information.
notsarc,"Very well said. However, we also believe that gun owners should get as much training as possible, necessary, desired etc. It just should not be required to participate in a Right Recognized by your Constitution as Inalienable, and therefore protected. That sets a bad precedence for the rest of our Bill of Rights. However, safe handling of any potentially dangerous tool is just common sense."
notsarc,"Exactly. That the change in moth color was due to natural selection was first posed in about 1896 by J.W. Tutt. The funny thing is that as pollution increased, the moths turned black, and then as the pollution was cleaned up, they turned white again. carbonaria have become pretty scarce."
notsarc,This makes more sense then anything else I've heard on this thread.

notsarc,"If same sex couples are offered equal rights under a PACS (or some other legally recognized union) as married couples, why does it matter which ""door"" they come in through? They get all the same benefits, including the benefits that come when one partner dies.What's the beef...except that you can't say that you're ""married""?"
notsarc,"There is never a question of ""killing people"" in such circumstances, it a matter of deciding if treatment should be withdrawn and thus allow them to die, i.e. where there is no possibility of any sort of a recovery."
notsarc,"I do not empathise with an embryo or early fetus the way I imagine I would with my late-term fetus or born child.I fully intend to have children in the future, including through adoption possibly. When I do I will love them with all my heart and put their needs above my own. I'm not going to do a half-assed job of parenting; I'll give it 100%.But not yet.Prototype:"
notsarc,"logic would lead one to believe abortion is wrong...but why be consistent in your thinking.The point is, logic and rational thinking is not a requirement to make a law. You can ban abortion is you want...the states did it and the constitution allows it, even if 5 legislatures think otherwise."
notsarc,"See above. A lock can create doubt about the ease of entry into a residence. Many criminals move from door to door until they find one that is unlocked, rather than drawing undue attention by smashing one in."
notsarc,"Well, there is a little more to it than that, but agreed."
notsarc,"Well said. It is a disgrace that the ""Flat Earth"" side of the argument never gets a look in geography lessons and that the ""Spontaneous Creation"" side of the argument never gets a look in when teaching kids about the life cycle of insects. Do you realise that they refuse to present the ""Cheese"" side of the argument when teaching about the moon these days? It's outrageous, how can our kids get a balanced education if such bias is allowed to continue!"

notsarc,"And the point was, Benjamin, that it is dishonest to cite the work of others, with no indication that it is the work of others. If you take what someone else wrote, they you need to indicate that, telling where you got it. If it is a book, then the author, title, publisher, date and page. If it is a web page, then the URL should be given.Even better, express your own point and tell how reference supports it. Tell why it is important and why it shows your opponent wrong - then just give a link. Generally AIG is really bad science and isn't very interesting. It is misleading, intentionally. However, on these boards are familiar with their stuff."
notsarc,"""True"" is not a good use of language to describe opinion. With regard to his opinion, I think he makes some good points, so I don't really need to ask him if its true.

Proverbs 13:13 he who feareth the commandment shall be rewarded. 14 The law of the wise is a fountain of life. 15 Good understanding giveth favor 16 Every prudent man dealeth with knowledge 17 a faithful ambassador is health 18 but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured. 19 The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul 20 He that walketh with wise men shall be wise 21 but to the righteous good shall be paid. What inheritance should a good man leave to his children's children? Solomon wasn't talking of money, but of God's law. In Solomon's view, the wicked can have their money, the true reward goes to the righteous. Why this should contrast with selling your luxuries and giving to the poor I'm not sure. "

notsarc,"Well, HRC estimates that the costs would be negligable and that some governments would actually save money. They site many studies on the issue, which I have not taken the time to look up, as I think this sort of statistic is worthless.

Still, you seem very concerned about it, so I will provide this link:http://www.hrc.org/Template.cfm?Sect...entDisplay.cfmIt is an interest group in favor of gay rights, yes, but that doesn't make them wrong.

notsarc,"But people start threads here all the time against Christianity regardless of whether someone claims something here about it or not. It's prejudice, pure and simple, and you're no exception.

I mean, one would think those of you are do this sort of thing would be happy that someone had pointed out the obvious prejudice going on, as it would be a case to help you move away from prejudicial thinking."

There is no clear cut fossils showing the evolution of man, is there. By ""true human"" I mean they were just like us, just varients of human kind that we have today - looked human, walked like us, most likely were quite intelligent.

notsarc,"Actually, this (if what that article is true, which I am not quite sure) is a healthy part of science. Old theories are disgarded and new ones come in as more evidence is brought to bare. Every theory made by fallible man is prone to being disproven and destroyed. Man's theories change everyday, while God's word has remained the same."
notsarc,"But it is based on history. There is plenty of history showing that women had illegal abortions. Or, if their families had money. went to Costa Rica or Britain to have a legal one in those countries.Women died or had severe medical emergencies due to illegal abortions. Doctors and nurses were prosecuted for providing these services."
notsarc,"Since evolution is a non-theistic theory (it does not consider if there is a god or not), you will have to look at some like http://www.theistic-evolution.com/I would also look up Kenneth MIller on the web... a highly Christian biologist who defends evolution."
notsarc,"?? What are you trying to say?Science is knowledge, all knowledge, that is, anything we find to be true. There is no other ""truth"" out there, if there were, we'd be omniscient."
notsarc,"Pregnancy is always harmful to the woman's body. However, if the pregnancy is desired then the changes are welcomed by the woman.To a woman who does not want to be pregnant then those changes are very unwelcome and are a bad thing. Pregnancy is always harmful, but the perception of what is happening changes depending on the woman.You do not understand that whether or not pregnancy harms the woman's body is objective, but whether or not the woman wants the pregnancy anyway depends on the woman. You are mixing the two."
notsarc,"**Here you reveal exactly what I've just spoken of--you assume that science and the scientific method equates to, is synonymous with, materialism/mechanism. It most certainly is not. Nor is the accompanying assumption, i.e., that any science which does not strictly adhere to materialust/mechanist assumptions, is not, and cannot be, real science. Equally untrue.Both assertions are unnecessary to an objective approach to science, per se, but are part and parcel of an emotional defence of materialism/mechanism and its biological aspect, RMNS darwinism."
notsarc,"This assumes brain-dead is a logical choice to consider one dead. Even so, it proves nothing about when life begins. What says they have to be the same? This is a classic example of a conclusion not following from the premise."
notsarc,And they could have experienced more without gun control. You're jumping to conclusions.
notsarc,"Like the above quote, why is the church trying to stop abortion when they would consider one to be alive after taking a breath. if you were to look at it from a scientific standpoint, the individual ovum and sperm are living cells, but they die all the time and no one cares. An embryo or fetus is something starting to develop into a human and that can't be stopped without killing it or injecting differnt DNA, but it's still not too different from sperm and ovum.If you can't trust the church to make fair decisions and follow values and morals and rules they put in place, how can you expect an honest good decision about anything from it."
notsarc,"The terrorists saw it as absolutly necessary. Personally, I disagree. When we kill children in Iraq, we see it as absolutly necessary, call it a horrible side effect of war. I disagree on that, too, I don't think it is necessary at all."
notsarc,"Yeah, see this is the old ""gateway drug"" fallacy.If anything is a gateway drug, it's alcohol, so why is it still legal?If a drug can act as a ""gateway"" to other drugs, isn't that why it's illegal?So are people sitting around drinking alcohol all day, waiting for someone to come by with something ""harder""? No, and the same is true for people who smoke pot. Oh, sure they may also do other things once and a while, but it wasn't simply because they tried that first joint. It's just a personality trait and a common one. If pot didn't exist, these people would be doing something else. The same with alcohol and cigarettes. If they didn't exist, people would find some other type of vice."
notsarc,So much for your cover. Its blown. You just made another gaps argument making the assumption that if theory X does not explain observation Y that a theory which is untested and untestable MUST be the only alternative explanation. Balderdash and shame on you. The alternative theories would likely be numerous and the ONLY one is not something untested and untestable.But I forgive you GOD probably made you make the error for his own mysterious reasons. Or else your statement is evil and was forced upon you by the devil. Maybe you will never know - in this life at least :(
notsarc,"Yes, the horror of voluntarily taking orders from someone in exchange for monetary rewards!!   If you hate your job that much, quit. You aren't being oppressed because someone offered you the option to do something. If you don't like it, don't do it. If you hate trade, you can go wander through the wilderness and eat berries and roots."
notsarc,"You said there that you wanted guns in schools so that kids could defend themselves. How is that a misinterpretation?   You're asking for proof of a negative. How many massacres would have occured if guns were common in school? We don't know...   Erm.... You're saying that people don't try to harm one another over those things? I suggest you surf youtube for a bit. Rememeber however, that kids are more emotionally unstable than adults. Hormones and guns aren't a good combination.   I agree that's silly. I'm more worried about your statement that students should carry in class."
notsarc,"Actually, it has.      The last time I checked, well still have gay marriages in Massachusetts. As a matter of fact, it seems that it is difficult for most politicians to be elcted in the state without being supportive of marriage equality."
notsarc,"Actually Electro, do you remember this thread?   Evidence for a flood? Oddly enough it took 20 pages before one of them even tried to argue against the reasons why the flood did not occur."
notsarc,You said who would it hurt? I'm asking you who would it hurt if there was prostituion? Just to help you think that there are injuries that are proximate to everyone.
notsarc,"Just because they're our representatives, doesn't give them permission to trample the Constitution and the protections provided to the citizens. Look at how many laws have been passed, only to be invalidated and ruled as unconstitutional."
notsarc,"You are assuming that the TOE of evolution has remained static since Darwins time.I have to say that is false. We have 150 years of experimental data beyond that. In addition, we not only have the arguement from homology, but we have genetic data to back it up. So sorry, but you struck out."
notsarc,What about the pain and death inflicted upon the innocent women and girls forced to give birth? Have you no regard for them?
notsarc,Whether a fetus is a person is not something open to consideration. An apple is not an orange. The reason that we have two words to apply as labels is simply because they absolutely are not the same thing. It is that simple.Suppose that a fetus is frozen and implanted in a female 22 years later. Is it of legal drinking age at birth? Obviously not. We currently have the technology to actually do this.
notsarc,You haven't proven anything. All you have done is spew your same old drivel which ignores what I actually say and reinterprets it to mean what you want it to say. You must corrupt what I say since you can't accept the truth of my beliefs and win your fallacious argument.
notsarc,"A being is something that is conceivable as existing...or something that actually exists.A human being is one of us, a homo-sapien, a member of the group of beings known as animals.A rock is a being of inanimate qualities.God is the supreme being, not capable of being understood totally as this would put Him (or It, or She) on the same level as those that He created.We will never be able to define exactly what or who God is!God is great.God is good.Let us thank Him for our food.God is my shepherd.God is my Light.God is my Co-pilot.God is what keeps me from believing that all this (the totality of all things and happenings) came about by accident.When God made man, She was only kidding! ;)"
notsarc,But we also don't know that evolution is true - it is a belief system about the past that requires faith for it to have any reason. Your first part is already false (proved above).
notsarc,"Iangb, I would have thought that you would be intellectually honest enough to have (at least) accepted the fact that I have supported my claims. I also thought that (by now) someone from your side of the abortion issue would step in (in this thread or by private message) and hold you to your claims of being 'intellectually honest.' At this point, I actually have you questioning Planned Parenthood's definitions? QUOTE; "
notsarc,"Well, the question I am asking is for you to provide a valid scientific prediction based on creationism."
notsarc,"Creationism is not something new, it was the prevailing view of scientists up until Darwin. None of them belived in a divine parrot that is just plain silly. In the crucible of natural science throughout the Middle Ages, the Scientific Revolution and well into the 19th century theology was the queen of the sciences. Now we subject students to higher math studies that they will most likely never use and speculations about conceptual mechanisms like natural selection that have no practical application. Naturalistic presumption has become sacrosanct in the rhetoric of the professional scientists who have been crystal clear on how they define creationism. You can ignore the statement by D.J.Futuyma and identical ones made by Gould, Mayr, Dawkins, Dobzhansky and others but not without departing from mainstream evolutionary biology. "
notsarc,"At what cost? How many civil rights are you willing to give up in the name of a few less murders each year? Are you perfectly willing to be stopped by the police on a block-by-block basis and forced to show identification and traveling papers, all the while the officers on location are pointing their guns right at your head, ready to XXXX you away at the first sign of a twitch or if you display even a hint of hesitation to comply?How desperately do you crave a police state? How much do you favor a nationwide curfew where violators can be arrested by the police and held without legal counsel for an indefinite period of time? Do you favor the use of physical and mental torture to force convictions even from the innocent?"
notsarc,"Well, if Genesis was in fact true, then we would have to assume that God is real and the Bible more or less explains what he wants, right? And if there is someone ""up there"" who will damn you to eternal torment if you don't do what he wants (which is one interpretation of the Bible) than that might effect the way you act. I realize that that isn't exactly the same as changing your moral compass, but history has demonstrated that most people's moral will stretch to accomodate pressing needs, and I think an actual vengeful diety would qualify."
notsarc,"So for example if I say ""you are a part of my body, and therefore I have a right to kill you"", is this simply a matter of ideology?I admit the distinction is not clearcut at early stages of development, but how do you support the idea that post-birth children are ""a part"" of their mothers' bodies and therefore legitimate to kill?It is no more legitimate to say that a fetus is a part of a woman's body than it is to say that a woman is a part of a fetus' body. Just as a woman is not a subordinate slave to the fetus within her, the fetus cannot be considered subordinate in rights to the woman it is inside."
notsarc,"23,000 firearms were handed in when the UK had its gun ban. According to your logic those people that handed in their firearms can still be prosecuted because they took possession of a firearm prior to the ban. I don't think so."
notsarc,"But bestiality consists of animal cruelty, so very much hurts another. Just not another human."
notsarc,"I think it goes something like that. Scientists have tried to repeat what they believe happened, but to no success. Anyway, atheistic evolution says that there is no intelligence, the scientists who were trying to repeat what may have happened have intelligence and they made many such measurements to try and create life from lifeless chemicals - in other words, the experiment was already logically flawed!"
notsarc,"The fact that they were too heavy, is simply untrue, see previous post. Hunting depends on many ecological factors, such as their predational preference. Also new fossils suggest a trees down development of bird flight so fully developed flight muscles and feathers were not necessary."

notsarc,"Hello, please read http://www.reasons.org/resources/apo...ing.shtml?mainIt is a good christian site that explains that there are lots of problems with Dr Russell Humphreys' hypothesis.The universe and Earth are very old.

notsarc,"Well, that's generally true of any process that uses energy. Some is wasted."
notsarc,I don't think that any marriage rights are required at all by the Consitution.
notsarc,"And I just say that it would be unjust and unfair of you to force metaphysical belief systems of your own which constitute religious belief upon your follows who may believe otherwise than you. Get pregnant and treat your fetus as a full person if you wish, nobody will force you to abort it. Let others follow their own beliefs differing or the same. Otherwise you attempt to obtain justice by doing injustice.Mo"
notsarc,"But growth is fairly irrelevant. My sperm can grow into a human too, and have mental existence, yet ejaculating isn't murder. It just becomes a huge debate on where to draw the line, therefore it is best to focus on the state that it is right NOW. Not what it was or could possibly be.That seems reasonable to me.[/QUOTE]"
notsarc,You know what is far worse than murder itself? Executing people to save some money.
notsarc,"Well be cynical if you want, if someone in your family had done as you ascribed you wouldn't be here to be so glib. Nor would the human race or any other species where penile-vaginal sex takes place. I guess all those years of biological reproduction show it. You will also notice I didn't make it an absolute statement. I said ""minimal or negligable physical damage"".I understand that female biology undergoes truama too during sex, the fact is the trauma of vaginal sex i.....1. more forgiving and 2. Obviously possible of greater/important final result. And um, like with lesbian activities, the size of the ""peg"" also matters so how do you know lesbian activities are a lot less harmful."
notsarc,"I see the difference, but that's not what Obama is trying to do. He got us to buy the pig at a firesale and is hoping to make money selling it back to the original farmer or give it to the fieldhands."
notsarc,"When the President is in public, there are plenty of people around him ...with guns."
notsarc,"I have no idea what this could possibly mean. It makes no sense, semantically or logically. It is so vague as a concept as to be worthless in terms of the pursuit of knowledge."
notsarc,"Intelligent design comes in many flavors too.ID that submits as a designer something that has any quality of the unknowable is irrational.ID that submits we were created/designed by things inside the universe that are knowable are rational claims. However, they have no evidence, so they have a long way to go to be shown to be worthwhile to pursue. Even a simple application of Occam's razor tells us that to suspect a thousand theories on how life has changed on earth is unecessary when another theory can fulfill the description entirely, of life, and they have evidence to support it. It's why this theory is discarded onto the heap of any number of theories that simply isn't going anywhere. You can make up a theory right now about how life began, but if it cannot be supported by evidence or is redundant to a theory already described...why would we?"
notsarc,"Just curious, is it beyond you to make a post that includes common sense and logic? I'm thinking it is since all of you posts seem to be based on rhetoric and emotion. Three paragraphs and all of them contain a falsehood/ lie, congrats your batting 1.000."
notsarc,So who's the head honcho?   It's not like all these professional scientists all see eye to eye. There are even scientists that hold to theistic evolution.
notsarc,"I believe a man should be able to opt out of fatherhood.The problem with this article for me is the moral ambiguity - there is no consistent argument laid out for free choice, that is choice for women and men, or even one for consistent slavery (forced births from women, forced money from men). It reeks of the vindictiveness that can be seen in any number of fringe movements, of the ""I don't really care whether we live in a just society, as long as you're not treated better than me"".So yes, I ""a real pro-choicer"" agree with Matt here, the pro-choicers who are portrayed as disagreeing appear to be some kind of stereotyped 1970s feminist-socialist-activist-bra-burning type."
notsarc,"If there is a positive relationship between drug consumption and crime, it doesn`t seem very likely that crime would go down as a result of lowering the price on drugs (and thus rasing consumption)."
notsarc,Actually it would be impossible for the monblock to spin. There is NO PLACE OUTSIDE OF IT from which to observe! Any observer would necessarily be inside the budding universe - no place else to go you see. Indeed its still impossible for us to know whether the universe as a whole is spinning or not!!!! Sorry I was being a bit ironic thinking you would see the point. Guess not though.
notsarc,"And that's the rub: it never has (apart from when it has of course, with the various versions that exist). You choose to put faith in the writings of a primitive bronze age society. I prefer to trust a textbook that is regularly updated to reflect our latest findings; our most up to date and accurate knowledge of the world."
notsarc,"Chuz, the purpose of this summary is not to summarise your arguments as a whole - it is to summarise what your argument is up to this point.   Why not post just a summary of your position so far, as you see it - I can do the same, then you can continue with your argument?   There's no point in writing an argument, summarising it and then leaving the thread before I've had a chance to respond to even your argument (never mind your summary). If you are going to simply ignore any criticisms of your reasoning, then I struggle to see the point of you repeatedly requesting a one-on-one debate in the first place - you essentially regress your argument to the 'because I said so' that you are (presumably) hoping to avoid, it's just that there's slightly more detail."
notsarc,Jake good try at manipulating scriptures. Jesus is all about family values. The point of thsoe scriptures is that His gospel is above everything else. The only thing that comes before family is GOD. He loves families but won't let a family bring someone down. The US rescues kids from bad homes too because to be in an enviroment that is detrimental serves no one.
notsarc,"This has everything to do with guns,how are these people suppose to protect   themselves?Since the police have been told to just let them go, crime will run   rampant, it will become THE place to go if you feel like duing a little robbery a little burglary,gosh wonder if they gotta let rapo's and killers runaway to.   Only 2000? I lived in George Wa. and the population was less than 2000,it was also just off I-90 and we had plenty of crime from people passing through not   necessarily from people who lived there."
notsarc,"Really? 'cuss what I always see with anti-choicers is that they seem to think that the pregnant woman is invisible. This means that all men and all fetuses have a right to life at all times, but women, for some unknown reason, seem to lose that right when they become pregnant. Weird."
notsarc,it has been known for a long time -- it's just been surpressed because it contradicts genetic determinism and neo-darwinsm in general.
notsarc,That distinction may be irrelevant since they do say that no god that any religious person believes in exists. And that is what I was getting at originaly. Still I think that the idea that the existence of all religious gods can be ultimately refuted based on the logic you bring up is invalid.
notsarc,"I think the OP said it pretty well. If an organism or cell can process information and then make decisions based on that information, that's intelligence."
notsarc,"Depends on the usage. Generally, it just refers to the Theory of Evolution or a change in allele frequencies in a population."
notsarc,"So please tell me who would be the actual criminals if the Government violated the Supreme Law of the Land and made all guns illegal?But I do thank you for proving that there are people out there who want them all, despite The Bill of Rights says and what the Supreme Court proved was the correct meaning!"

notsarc,"If this is what passes for American healthcare, then your need for change is even more desperate. None of these ""treatments"" is available on the NHS."
notsarc,"Sure they matter. But that isn't the issue here. You posted this in the abortion forums as if this medical malpractice which is taking place in an impoverished third world country is justification for it in America. That is a ludicrous and totally bogus argument to make.If you thought rationally, you would have it in the health forum and be complaining about how third world countries are so ill prepared for this common problem when we have the technology so readily available to avoid it. My Lord simone, a simple C-Section is all that is required to make this a non issue for mother and baby. But you ignorantly post this drivel as if abortion is the solution. It makes no sense at all, and yet you post it thinking that you're contributing something rational. Go figure, huh!!! emoticonXFrazzled"
notsarc,"Oh, I don't think there's anything wrong with it, I'm completely for it."
notsarc,"Well to get healthcare from $6000 per person to $3,400 per person you'd have to pay them less or fire them. So do I understand you correctly that we will either cut pay or fire doctors and nurses?EDIT: that seems dramatic...not ""fire"" them but they will basically go into another profession since they are no longer needed."
notsarc,But doesn't Genesis imply that creation occured in one 7-day period (though the days could be symbollic)?
notsarc,"This question is premised on an untenable assumption: that people should not be allowed to vote on particular issues. This premise is clearly not true in any democratic society, and is especially not true in the United States. In the United States, it is a contradiction in terms to say someone is not allowed to vote on X. I have demonstrated this before, and yet the same silly question keeps coming up."
notsarc,"I think that's a good question. I also wonder how long the medical establishment has had this rule? Since there must be some long-standing procedures in executions in the United States that require, by law, a doctor's supervision."
notsarc,"Though I know you directed this question at Cthulhu, I will nonetheless jump in to say that I would quickly choose the newborn mentally retarded baby to live and the zygote to die. That is obvious to me since the mentally retarded baby is a currently existing person vs. the zygote being merely a potential person. That zygote may have more potential for the future but the decision is being made in the present. I would feel far more guilt in sentencing a real person to die than in sentencing a potential person (now merely a cell) to die."
notsarc,"That interpretation is fine except that God says, ""I WILL make a helper suitable for him."" He hadn't made the animals yet in verse 18, but he created Adam in verse 7."
notsarc,Apparently you thought I was claiming that pro-lifers thought that the baby's life was more valuable than the mother's life. So I clarified:
notsarc,"Well if you're going to quote that article that mentions Canada to support your opinion, then does that mean you're in favor of gun registration and licensing? Canada has them. And if the NRA is really interested in enforcing laws why do they ask congress to reduce the budget of law enforcement? The NRA uses its political muscle to make it easier for criminals to obtain guns. Robert Ricker, former top lawyer of the NRA, talks about it. "

notsarc,"Not many women would say they had an abortion now, let alone back when it was illegal.It is an emotionally trying event. I can understand why she wouldn't for that reason alone. Another possibility is that the Administration is buying her silence, or it could be a combination of the two."

When you describe an idea as simple minded you are saying it is wrong and one would have to be simple-minded to think that."

notsarc,Do you actually have any idea how science works? Why are you not embarrassed for creationism?
notsarc,I see. So you can't give an example of a dinosaur being dated with carbon 14. None of us thought you could.

I don't know what that ""incipient organ"" junk is supposed to mean. Is that another way of saying ""what good is half a wing."" Well, check out a penguin to find out. Look at a seal flipper. It has the same bones, arranged in the same way as a monkey. What good is it for a land animal? And what does ""fully functional"" mean? What function? Perhaps the new organ had a different purpose - take the clawed hands of fossil birds for example. They were good for catching prey and climbing, just like they were for their dinosaur ancestors. But those clawed wings also allowed early birds to fly."
notsarc,"They are both written in the bible. Neither of them have any evidence (apart from the bible) to support their existence. One of them has been proven to be utterly false.

notsarc,"Actually, we didn't. The first record of a melanic form was in 1848. Presumably other melanic individuals had appeared before this, both in Biston bebularia as well as other moths. We know that a similar mutation occucrred in other moths North America some years after the 1848 record of the B. betualria.There are actually several alleles of the gene responsible for color that form a dominence hierarchy with the fully black morph (called carbonaria) as the top dominant and the typical as recessive. The intermediate forms are referred to as insularia. They are uncommon. At any rate, by 1895, 98% of observed B. betularia in industrialized areas were carbonaria."

notsarc,"Oh it's no mistake Montalban. I, unlike you, am quite clear in my arguments, and have a direction and a goal. We can take your other definitions of creationism one at a time, thank you very much. I'd like to first focus on the one that involves your god, or any god, described as being unknowable (which you have said your god is). Will you ""allow"" us to focus on ONE thing? You see, if we have a list of 4 things, and we go through them one by one, we can maybe arrive at the end!!! Crazy thought isn't it!"
notsarc,"I'm not sure where anyone said it related to evolution, the big bang, etc., but I might have missed something."
notsarc,But it should be the job of science to establish a clear line between just where established fact stops and philosophy starts. There's no indication that they're getting it done.
notsarc,You're working at the wrong end of the problem. We need young to survive. It's the old that are expendable.
notsarc,But that is your goal whether you want to admit it or not. And that is your sole way of defending creationism as you have admitted you cannot argue creationism based on its own merits. Creationism is wrong independent of Evolution. Even if you somehow manage to disprove evolution (along with every science) you still have to even take a single step towards proving Creationism.
notsarc,"you based this (and other claims) on a summary of the biomorphs program at website that either a) didn't also provide dawkins limitations on the program or b) had the limitations and you didn't bother to relay this information to the forum. You then make incredulous statements about how unrealistic the biomorphs are. any quotations of web pages are irrelevant because they do not address the basic issue that you are suggesting dawkins puts the biomorphs forth as a model of evolution and natural selection. This is not true as i have quoted part of his book that puts limitations on the biomorphs program, and draws attention to what ""morals"" should be drawn out of the biomorphs."
notsarc,You don't have to be the best organism to survive. You just have to be good ENOUGH.
notsarc,"Well firstly we do not know that ""volition"" must be embodied in living organisms only - computers MIGHT be capable of exhibiting it. I think you will find that there is NO valid reason for believing otherwise. And volition itself is NOT a defining characteristic of life. No biologist would buy that assumption. Sponges, bacteria, corn plants etc etc etc are mindless organisms and so far as can be determined do not act out of volition."
notsarc,"Just to be sure you understood, it was the picture below that picture you were supposed to look at."
notsarc,And you believe that to be what? You really need to just say who/what you think the Creator is to save us from having to make all these clarification posts.
notsarc,"So what if he dislikes science? If he believes something else, he has the right to believe that way. My problem here is that he shows more closed-mindedness to the viewpoints of others."
notsarc,It doesn't matter whether it is religous or not. The odds of anyboy being fired over such a thing are slim to none. Morning after pills can not possibly make up eough of any given pharmacys revenue to make it worth the expense of replacing a skilled employee.
notsarc,"this statement isn't logical.It does not follow that if the person who creates the laws has to therefore follow them or can't change them...or even that they apply to him. If a teacher says ""no talking in the classroom"" it doesn't apply to the teacher now does it."
notsarc,"So please, feel free to leave this thread to those who DO wish to discuss the issue. No one is forcing you to discuss the topic of this or any other thread. I notice you evidently are not interested in ""Understanding ""Sexual Prejudice"""" That is absolutely fine with me.Or are you now opposed to ""Freedom of Speech"" also?"
notsarc,Not true Our laws were originally founded on the precepts of the 10 commandments........
notsarc,So then women who are pregnant shouldn't be allowed to   1) Smoke   2) Take any kind of drug that could possibly harm the child   3) Drink   or do any otherwise legal action?   And VOR takes another giant step towards fascism.
notsarc,"But the belief that 'its gotten us far' is itself a 'scientific' type belief, in fact it has less proof on the empirical assumptions than the science itself. Justifying the validity of experience by experience is the intellectual equivalent of saying'God must exist, because God is good and would not allow a world without God'."
notsarc,"Oh, buddy, Atheism has EVERYTHING to do with that. The morality-less framework of Atheism ALLOWED them to justify the horrors that they inflicted."
notsarc,"I may be a pro-gunner but what doe's that have to do with with gay rights?   Since I'm a pro- gunner I won't force my life style or views on you,if you don't force yours on me.Deal?   After all you seem to be the expert on gay rights."
notsarc,"1 - It is innacurate. We allow killing in times of war, in self defense, and in state sanctioned executions. So we already have a situation where, when given X mitigating factors, it is justifiable to take a life. It is impossible to say all life is equal, and then to apply that as law. People will be outraged. I know I would be.2 - Objective to who? Who gets to decide how valuable life is? And why should they get to? And who says they are right? The relative value of life works fine, thanks very much."
notsarc,"Actually, as long as any group is not breaking laws, their ownership of guns is legal. The KKK can even own guns as long as the KKK is abiding by the law. I noticed Brady refered to the KKK as a mob, I get the picture Brady thinks that if gun owners gather for whatever the reason, that we are mobs as well, but when his side gathers they are an organization. And no Brady, I dont belong to or associate with hate groups."
notsarc,"Don't you think this would fit the 'Creationism is nothing but lie's thread a bit better? Although I notice The Skeptic making disparaging remarks about your examples, it seems he attacks you more than deal with the well documented   examples you have."
notsarc,"But the big bang did not create matter. Matter can neither be created nor destroyed. The matter was already there.You might just as easily ask if god was there to create the universe, where did this god come from.Your answer would be that god has always been there, but I would argue that the matter has always been there. The only difference between these theories is that mine has one less assumption."
notsarc,"Again, this wasn't just about you and me. I do think you corrected someone's spelling and if you didn't it was another creationist."
notsarc,"Yes, they do show a faithful devotion to the ultimate reality that there are no gods. You're an atheist, aren't you?"
notsarc,"Please define ""climb upward"" and ""downhill slide"" in biologically meaningful terms. Please define ""degeneration."""
notsarc,"Considering your previous comment, that isn't you. Once again, that opinion is based upon who you read."
notsarc,"Steve - its not about qualifications - its about impact. Women are the ones who get pregnant, we should have more authority in the matter."
notsarc,"Having human DNA does not necessarily make one a human being. Transgenic animals can have human DNA, does that make them human beings."
notsarc,Because you know the peer review process is biased. Anything submitted for peer review with a recognizable name like Dembski or Behe will be automatically rejected before the first word is read. The scientific community's problems are just that big.
notsarc,So you're accusing me of the thing that your most guilty of? As I remember your posts have been censored several times by admin because you resorted to viscious personal attacks and name calling. And aren't you interested in the truth. Why isn't whether Jefferson said it or not important?
notsarc,"No, that was not an argument. It was an illustration of a point. The point was this: that in order to stand in moral judgment of God, you would have to be of higher moral character than God. In other words, you would have to be God in order to judge God. Now, the point I made is that this is highly unlikely, as any being claiming to be God would not misspell words, no matter how closely the letters are on the keyboard.To be clear, I was not attacking you (at least I didn't intend to) by calling out your spelling mistake. I was trying to illustrate a point. And the point was this: you are not perfect, and therefore, you are not God. And if you are not God, then you really cannot stand in moral judgment of God."
notsarc,"And once it has begun, which would you rather have?"
notsarc,"the blog is just the link for the article....geez, get a grip."
notsarc,"But it's not detecting any ""new"" wavelength. It's just detecting a wavelength that our eyes are incapable of detecting. You can't see radio waves, so radio waves are meaningless to your eye, but they're not meaningless to your clock radio receiver."
notsarc,"With all the debt Obama has generated for our nation, he deserves to be filibustered into the ground. For too long the democrats had absolute power and ran amok and unchecked, answering to absolutely nobody and ignoring the will and the voice of the people."
notsarc,The thing is the Dempski didn't provide any kind of testable or detectable definition about what information is either. He used vague but scienficially sounding terms to push his case. He knew it too.
notsarc,"George Bush won the majority of votes (the first majority winner in 16 years) in an election with the highest turnout in US history (>117Million voters). The Senate Minority Leader was defeated by a nobody. Democrats lost at least 3 seats in each of the House and Senate, something that never happens in a Presidential election year. This gave the Republican majority in both branches of Congress even more control. 11 Liberal ballot initiatives went down in flames by huge margins. If liberalism ISN'T dead, then it's in ICU on a heart and lung machine. emoticonXRolleyes "
notsarc,Because there are people who are trying to deny the theory of evolution it's place as a vital part of public school's biology curriculum.
notsarc,"Did you read the article? A capuchin is type of monkey, in this case, the type that was used in the experiment."
notsarc,"It is an acronym for 'Y'oung 'E'arth 'C'reationist. In other words... someone who believes that the earth is only 6,000 - 10,000 years old and was created in six days by a being known as God."
notsarc,Well I guess Nato basically::p summed it up:Stupid is as stupid doe's.
notsarc,And it is much easier to have an abortion than to be a mother.
notsarc,It's one thing that stands between us and a mindless theocracy. It protects the freedom of women from would-be ayatollahs who would make them sexual slaves.
notsarc,"What are you talking about? Please define information. What does ""new"" information have to do with natural selection or evolution? Evolution is NOT defined by evolutionary biologists as an increase in information.So I ask again, please define information in a meaningful way as it applies to DNA and the genome of an organism."
notsarc,But the law of angular momentum does not require that all parts of a spinning object spin in the same way now does it. If so then something like a rotary engine for an aircraft would not be possible!
notsarc,"No, not in the least. It's real intent was to throw a bone to the people pretending to have ""family values"". The religious right, the conservatives, that lot."
notsarc,"I think that we've got to draw a line at some point, to demarcate between adult and child. Where ever we do draw it, it will seem, in some situations to be arbitrary. If we made it 20, the question would be why 20 year olds and not 19. Through the years society has determined that by 18 people should have attained enough life experience to form intent and to comprehend that their actions have consequences (at least as it applies to the death penalty, they can be tried as adults w/o death). We don't execute people who can't comprehend the nature of their crimes and society says that, under 18 you can't fully comprehend criminal actions."
notsarc,I believe the large majority of such deaths occur among inner city kids who don't know anything about guns except for what they see on TV and movies.
notsarc,"Huh? With a 26"" barrel the .50 is good out to 2100 yards. With the 29 or 36 that increases to 2500, but the world record sniper shot was made with a .50 BMG and it was 2657 (1.51 miles)."
notsarc,Actually I don't deal with spanish or french because I don't have to. I speak english. emoticonXRolleyes
notsarc,"Preganancy should not be used as a punitive measure against women who are sexual. What you think is not reflective of the reality of women and their cicumstances that exist in the world. The reasons to abort are numerous and complicated. Some reasons are more valid than others. But you have no way of knowing that for millions of women, only they can really know.And although there are some youngsters in this forum who negate life experience, it is not to be negated. Ther is a lot to be said for ""walking in a mile in another's shoes"". Be careful about your desire to take the life circumstances of a stranger in your hands. Are you ready to be morally cuplable for the damage you could do?"
notsarc,"Thats a very good question. To be honest - I would prefer no legislation period - but I would not get up in arms about a late term restriction like I described because 1) a fetus could very well survive outside of the mom at that point, 2) most reputable doctors won't conduct an abortion at that stage without a legitimate medical reason anyway."
notsarc,"I think a free society works better by saying ""You have to have at least a certain variety to give your customers a choice in products"". Businesses should have the restrictions, not private citizens."
notsarc,"That's not exactly true now, is it? People get to vote for elected officials, and that's all that's guaranteed federally. Some states have provisions for allowing people to vote on local laws, but in some states the government is allowed to prevent the vote. And of course there is no provision at all allowing the people to vote on federal laws. So in point of fact it is a true statement that in the United States someone is not allowed to vote on X, for some values of X."
notsarc,"How is that related to deterrence?       Once again, deterrence is preventing through the fear of consequences.      What you are talking about is not related to the subject of deterrence."
notsarc,"True, but what i was trying to state is that the bible has little to do with christianity if you dont believe in it. I know many christians who believe in god, and jesus etc, but think the bible is completely false, and is only a book of fables. Thats what i was trying to imply."
notsarc,"You know, I heard that from my mom last week. My parents moved to Arkansas when my dad retired a few years back. Mom thought it was amusing and disgusting that the state she moved to would have voted in such an alarming manor yet takes no measure to secure the marriages they already have. Ironic indeed."
notsarc,"You SERIOUSLY need to take a basic biology course so you can stop sticking your foot in your mouth emoticonXRolleyes An egg is NOT larva, and larva is NOT a caterpillar, and a caterpillar is NOT a butterfly - much the same as a zygote is NOT a embryo, and a embryo is NOT a fetus, and a fetus is NOT a baby, and a baby is NOT an adult. I challenge you to prove that a larva is exactly the same as a butterfly. If you can't even do something as simple as that, then you'll never understand the process/transformation of what a human has to go through, and THAT in and of itself should give you a clue as to how much in denial you are in, and how much you have to twist the truth around just to justify your version of events. Deal with it!"
notsarc,This seems to conflict with some of your earlier posts wherein you support terrorists.
notsarc,"And if there are two competing hypotheses that are actually hard to choose between? As they get closer, it becomes less possible to choose by instinct or testing. A principle comes in handy."
notsarc,"Would that work like the ban on illegal drugs in American? Does that ban keep illegal drugs out of American? The ban on illegal drugs does one thing, it does keep illegal drugs from law-abiding citizens. Law-abiding citizens are the only ones that respect the law when it comes to bans."
notsarc,"For me, this is like the idea that the speed of light was once very fast and has now slowed down. Both ideas indirectly call god a liar. This is bad. If all of our experiments show the Earth is 4.5 billion years old, then that is how old it is. If the Bible says something different, then either God meant Genesis for peoples past and now uses scientists to explain things better (though I am uncomfortable with this idea as many scientists are atheists), or our puny minds, compared with God's, haven't yet worked out how Genesis and an old Earth tie together."
notsarc,"The comic relief doesn't even recognize it has passed in on, or attempted to!"
notsarc,"YES! the founding fathers realized government was to serve the people it governed. With out a set of rules that limited the government it would run wild (as england did). They made the bill of rights and constitution so that it would limit the government (to keep it from becoming too powerful, and overstepping it's bounds). And the only way the constitution could actually be enforced was for the population to uphold it.Back in the time of it's writing they probably saw the best way for a population to force a government to not over step it's bounds was to force it... er... by force.Today in the information age, a much better weapon is our right to vote. Sweeping changes can be implemented with out the use of force using the system. "
notsarc,"But you are forgetting life-without-parole (and I do mean WITHOUT parole). With life without parole, there is also no recidivism."
notsarc,And there are plenty of people who smoke who don't develop lung cancer. You're cherry picking.
notsarc,Right. And that is the reason for peer review. Creationists don't subject their ramblings to peer review. That is why so much care is devoted to the proper construction of experiments to test the hypotheses by real scientists. Creationists just invent ad hoc stories without any experimentation.
notsarc,"A more precise term would be ""broaden,"" since nothing about the definition pertaining to the people currently covered by it would be affected, ""diluted"" or altered in any way anyone has yet demonstrated. Nothing about the definition that pertains to people who already are, or can be married changes one iota. Their rights, benefits, and protections remain exactly the same. The only ""change"" would be to other  people, people who have no connection to, nor impact on, the marriages of anyone else: the gays who'll marry if the legal definition is broadened to encompass them. And the only ""change"" in that regard will be the fact that they are  encompassed by it, nothing more. No substantive aspect of the definition as it currently stands changes in the slightest.The change is not in the definition itself. It's in who it applies to."
notsarc,"Excuse me, but you didn't fully read what he wrote. He didn't say that he supported abortion. He said that he wasn't as much a freak about it as you're being."
notsarc,Evolution wasn't introduced until 1859. When did abortion become popular?The industrial revolution occurred in the 1800s. Maybe that was the cause of abortion's alleged popularity.Grover Cleveland was elected in the 1800s. Clearly he had something to do with the alleged increase in abortion's popularity.The American Civil War occurred in the 1800s. It must have been the impetus for the rise in popularity of abortion.A human embryo does have features that look like gill slits. They are not gills but pharyngeal clefts. No modern book presents any information that human embryros have gill slits as if it is fact.
notsarc,"Well let me put it like this, I consider it your duty because if you don't protect yourself then you basically shift that responsibility to someone else. Not only is this incredibly selfish, but 9 out of 10 times the 'protection business' gets outsourced to the State.This in itself it dangerous because when people decide that a third party like the State (which has no real accountability) has control over their lives it can all to easily lead to a situation where the State becomes tyrannical.More people have been killed by their own government than by any foreign government."
notsarc,"Hang on....think about it.......if there is a large group of people who live in the south, and this large group of people moved to the north, WHY -- being from the south -- would there be anyone in the population that had light skin? Look at Iraq -- all those people have the same exact skin color. Same with Kenya. Same with Japan. Same with Russia. Thus, if any of those groups of people were to migrate, they'd all be in the same boat! There would be NO measurable variation of skin color. Your premise is faulty -- as is the whole premise of Toe."
notsarc,And can you please tell me the difference between nonrandom variation and directed variation? I'd also like a link to verify what you say. Thank you. God Bless!
notsarc,"And yet you ""and other women"" feel free to impose their version of reality on innocent lives."
notsarc,"So...what was all that bull**** about terrorists exploiting America's ""weak gun control laws"" in order to amass arsenals of deadly weapons?It seems to me that they don't need undercover operatives to come to America, forge documents and undergo background checks just to get civilian weapons. They've got their own arms manufacturing plants over there, they can make whatever they need or want."
notsarc,"Apart from the 'horizontally instead of vertically' part which I didn't understand - we're a hundred or so years too late, unfortunately. You might as well ask for an example of a book or website on cosmology that 'admits' the sun may just be a big ball of fire pushed by a scarab beetle, and not a nuclear furnace about which the earth orbits. There comes a point where continuing to seriously 'consider' a viewpoint becomes a waste of time and resources, because sufficient testing has been done and evidence recovered to discount it. We may one day encounter evidence that completely overturns the whole applecart, but so far it hasn't happened."
notsarc,"The quality of life ethic is far different from sactity/dignity of life ethic. A quality of life ethic carried out to its logical conclusions does not promote a pro-life society. Instead, there would be genocide against the handicapped, elderly, and people who people of power have deemed life unworthy of life. The problem with this ethic is that it is centered in arbritrary people deciding arbritarily which person passes the ""quality of life"" test."
notsarc,"Actually, I don't ask how the idea occurred. As I mentioned, Darwin suggested it. I'm not sure what the rese of that paragraph means."
notsarc,"Because everyone is equal in the eyes of the law, and rightly so. As for moral standing, you see no problem with equating his immoral behaviour with your own response. Most would."
notsarc,"Actually there is a better solution.   Mandatory male and female birth control pills, financial penalties if you stop taking. Anyone who would get off the pill would want a kid, therefore, abortions would cease."
notsarc,"I think you do not know what you are talking about. Your description fits the matter ""god"" you belive in."
notsarc,"Anyway Duo_Maxwell this isn't only creationist debaters, there are many more who do the same thing with different debates. you also forgot7. Make random accusations of logical fallacies when they have no idea what they even mean. Example: You said that my spelling is wrong, that's the biggest strawman I've ever heard8. Correct spelling mistakes and convienantly not answer the question. Example: ""What do you thinkk of carbon dating?"" ""you spelled think wrong"". If you want to correct spelling, fine but answer the question as well."
notsarc,"Yes because it is ""officially"" a life.Whether a person believes in life at conception or not they all agree it is life at birth and half way through life it is still life and right before death it is still life.If she does not want the child she can refrain from sex,use a contraceptive or abortion.If he does not want it he can refrain from sex (not likely for men),use a condom (not a guarantee to work),have surgery (hard to reverse) but that is it.So if he was to use a condom and get her pregnant she still has the last option."
notsarc,"Well, since you've called those who've disagreed with you here stupid (and variations thereof), and insinuated that they're too stoned to understand you, I think you have the most ground to make up. You also provide no support for your statements, most of which were debunked years ago as drug czar propoganda."
notsarc,Ludacris and many others in the hip hop scene disrespect women with their lyrics and videos. Much of what hip hop puts out contributes to unwanted pregnancies.
notsarc,You have to remember that those christians believe that the laws of God superceed those of man. That thier allegiance is to God and his laws above those of the constitution. They also believe that all should be subject to Gods by force if nesesary.
notsarc,"You're an idiot who has obviously never worked ina first responder category. If you think that increasing the volume and social acceptance of drug use to the same level of alcohol will 'solve' anything, then you are just an idiot. You have obviously never seen whart drug abuse does to families and people's lives. You're right, alcohol is worse, and the main reason its worse is because of 2 reasons, volume and availability ala social acceptance. Legalizing all drugs would have catastrophic social impacts.Don't feed me that line about taxing it and using the money for rehab. We have taxed the XXXX out of tobacco and alcohol the last 100 years and the last time I checked alcoholism and lung cancer hadn't been erradicated."
notsarc,"But it, along with the uranian tapeworm hypothesis, is just as valid as intellegent design as a hypothesis. Actually, the uranian tapeworm hypothesis,. as far fetched as it may be, is more testable than a supernatural designer.I think maybe the kids SHOULD be taught intellegent design as an example of pseudo-science. Hopefully they will see why it is not science and why evolutionary theory is."
notsarc,"You mean that it must have has a beginning, don't you?"
notsarc,"Yes, but if seen from space (something the ancients couldn't do) it LOOKS like it hangs on nothing. Don't worry, I don't mind spelling it out for you."
notsarc,"And I think that if I fall off a tall cliff, I'll die. Does that mean that gravity and science are either evil or incorrect?"
notsarc,"Yes. It describes an action without ascribing its form to its end result, outcome, whatever but strictly to a cause/s force/s in action. That is why 'selection' is always teleological. In order to select or choose anything, an end must always be in view. There must always be a volitional discrimination of options based upon a criterion dictated by the desired end. The only time ""channel"" becomes teleological is when something live [a human or a beaver, let's say] intententionally does the channeling. But since it is understood that mechanical forces can also 'channel', unintentional, out of simple mechanics, the word channel cannot be called teleological. In the same way, 'sorting' can be considered non-teleological, hence mechanical, and thus suited to your glossary, because things can be sorted by mechanical forces alone. But 'selection' always requires volition and awareness. So 'selection' is always teleological."
notsarc,You lost me there. Try them how and for what?
notsarc,"And here we have a leading YEC showing how he starts with his preexisting religious position and is not about to change it, no matter what the scientific evidences show."
notsarc,"Invalid argument to assert that mutations can map a road outside of their assigned task in illogical, where would the information to do so come from? Biology works because every individual cell doing what it was created to do along with what the one next to it was, though created to perform another set of instructions creates the molecular change that the combination of the cells together would produce. But there is no additional information there... not int he way you assert."
notsarc,Said like a cruel evil person who has no concern for his fellow man.
notsarc,"The idea of abortion as population control is absurd, especially forced abortions as someone mentioned a few posts ago. Anyone who has read a biology book knows the world has methods of population control on its own, we don't need to be doing stuff like that ourselves."
notsarc,"And she was having unprotected sex? So she knew becoming pregnant was a possibility? Yeah, I could see that being condemned by pro-lifers."
notsarc,"That's EXACTLY the point. Regardless of whether or not human minds think differently, whichever mind produced and agrees that 2+2=4 is absolutely correct, the rest are wrong. We know this because we can observe and test the concept in the physical world and prove that it is true. This goes for just about anything, dissention in the face of facts does not change the facts.IMHO, this invalidates your claim that something produced in the human mind is not absolute due to some human minds being contradictory."
notsarc,"Well then maybe you can prove it somehow. California has all these laws you support, and even more than that. So if they have these laws on the books and have had them for a while now, and if they're effective at fighting crime, then you must surely have evidence of some sort to prove your case."
notsarc,"No offense, but I am in my early teens and understand the situation more than you."
notsarc,"What's your point? Of course they will be bound by Heller just as the courts are bound by Roe v. Wade. That point wasn't in dispute. As long as you're talking about 19th Century Second Amendment case law, I like The State v. Buzzard (1842)."
notsarc,"1) Charliegone's article was a published research article.I would love to know where ""NARTH's"" editorial was published, if it even was published.2) NARTH's article DID NOT show any ""higher homosexual activity"" because of legalized gay marriage.It thoroughly failed to show ANY rise in homosexuality in ANY ""gay marriage"" country. It showed some studies which were reportedly done in those countries, but that's it."
notsarc,"And how exactly do you propose this suggestion actually be enforced? Have you got it all thought out and prepared to defend in a debate, or are you just throwing out what the liberal loonies tell you is a good idea?"

notsarc,"I'll give you that, though there is a whole school of debate about what thoughts are."
notsarc,I see no mention below of any judges in Mass.
notsarc,Which of course says volumes. On the other hand such metaphors are appropriate in many cases. For example consider the vaccination program for smallpox which eradicated the disease FAPP. It was indeed a struggle and new tools and techniques were critical to reaching the objective. From Jenner to the end of the virus as a human pathogen.
notsarc,"And you will cowardly ignore the validity of the difference, as you whine that there is one ...A person goes to the doctor, that information is NOT public information. A doctor / patient can claim doctor/patient confidentiality. It's a recognized and valid situation.But with the ""knowthyneighbor"", these polls are PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE. The purpose of publicizing them is to prevent fraud.If you weren't so intent on trying to bash, you would recognize the obvious distinctions... emoticonXRolleyes"
notsarc,"Yes, but I think you missed my point. I stated this above, remember the prohabition? People actually drank MORE alchohal. Without a ban, law abiding citizens and criminals will have them, with a ban, there will be just criminals."
notsarc,"And compare that to an equivalent sized human - if you compared the skill to a 10-13 year old boy, the erectus skeleton's cranial capacity would be significantly smaller. Doesn't contradict in the slightest other than the bizarre positions you decide other people should hold."
notsarc,"I know what you meant.My comment was to demonstrate the counter side of the issue.Interracial marriage laws were overturned at a time when this country disapproved of interracial marriage by a margin of three to one.By your approach, interracial marriage laws SHOULD NOT have been overturned in the 1960's.In fact, by your approach we still would have had illegal interracial marriage into the late 80's, early 90's.The 14th amendment makes no proviso about allowing unjust discrimination in cases of majority rule.By your approach, WHAT WOULD BE THE POINT?If the majority disapproves of the discrimination, they simply ""vote"" it out of existence. No need for the courts at all."
notsarc,But your own link says that the rise in crime was partially explained by the new system the UK police were using for recording crime and that the British Crime Survey showed a decrease in crime since 1997.
notsarc,You say that alot but discussion is about taking other people seriously.
notsarc,But is the Red Cross Christian? Obviously most contributors are Christian. That's obvious as most Americans are Christian.
notsarc,And your point was demonstrated to be specious using your own source. To contain strawmen even as you claimed it to be a strawman.
notsarc,It wouldn't. Altering any of the fundamental universal constants changes them all. We wouldn't be considering some small change here and small change there. The universe probably wouldn't exist in any form.
notsarc,"Not by any means. Evolution works on genetic change that future generations will inherit. Adaptation does no such thing. It changes an individual, but not its genes.For example, if my parents volunteered to be part of a scientific experiment where they two additional arms fused onto their body before I was ever conceived, I would not be born with two extra arms.On the other hand, if a genetic mutation made it advantageous to have two additional arms, and both my parents had that mutation, I would be born with both arms."
notsarc,"How do you explain the change of appearance of the animals over time, as recorded by fossils?"
notsarc,"That's not evidence, that's an assertion. As for my dogs (cats), yes. They do put on a winter coat in the much warmer winter climate than Arizona in which I live. So I return to my original question, on what evidence do you base your claim that an arctic fox would not change color in the winter in Arizona?"
notsarc,"The Second Amendment does not apply to an Ohio Law. Thus, this ban is not unconstituitonal under the US Constitution. The Ohio Constitution, may however, protect gun rights, but I haven't read it."
notsarc,"I'm sure you reproduce these quotes in good faith, but you ought to know they are not necessarily what they seem. The Darwin quote is a particularly craven quote mine: he was expressing empathy with those of his readers who found it difficult to imagine how such a thing as an eye could evolve by stages; effectively putting himself in their place so that he might more readily take them by the hand and show them how such evolution may occur, with ample supporting evidence from the natural world. I refer you to the Quote Mine Project for further edification."
notsarc,How do you know carbon dating is so accurate? Would you bet your life on it?
notsarc,"No, we shouldn't abolish every flawed system. However, when the flaw results in putting innocent people to death, it is not worth the risk.In 26 years the death penalty has been in effect in my home state of Illinois, there have been more people exonerated due to irrefutable evidence than have been put to death. I think that constitutes a serious problem."
notsarc,"You know that, I know that, but the creationists do not know that."
notsarc,"I'm not trying to participate in gang debate, but well..The population of ""people with heart trouble"" would only be in jeopardy if the heart trouble made it more difficult to reproduce. If reproduction is not hindered then there is much less chance of dying off."
notsarc,"People are protected by law from being harassed, assaulted and/or murdered because they are people. Not because they are a certain religion. Because they are people it would be wrong to allow such things."
notsarc,"I think often abortion is wrong but I do not agree with criminalizing it. Primarily the reasons that are used to justify criminilzation are hugely fallacious and secondarily because it won't do a thing that is positive. A woman who is determined to end her pregancy - will. Criminalization will simply make it extremely dangerous. I am responsible, have even had my tubes tied, but if I were to become pregnant and that pregnancy were the result of rape or a threat to my health or livlihood I would end it - and I will not be checking the law books first. Every woman has her line in the sand - abortion will go on regardless of its legal standing. There are a miriad of reasons seek abortion - comdemning those reasons does nothing (i.e. calling them selfish) - addressing them could help. The reasons are valid."
notsarc,"Bad, bad, bad. :( 1) Reducing meat consumption will create a change towards more agricultural farming which is more sustainable for humans and the environment.1) Some, perhaps all ""Livestock feed"" is actually edible for humans; GM maize is regularly consumed in the US and Mexico.2) One does not have to consume those foods as there are thousands of plant foods that can be eaten."
notsarc,"Do me a favor. Write, in your own words, two paragraphs. One explaining the electromagnetic spectrum (and the visible spectrum's place in it), and one discussing rods and cones in the eyes."
notsarc,"Nonsense, societies change over time, therefore they evolve. Only biological populations evolve through natural selection and the theory of evolution only applies to biological populations, but the term ""evolution"" applies to other things too."
notsarc,"No, say you've got 200 of some species. By some event, 100 member are seperated. Now we have two groups of 100. Each group goes through different selections and they accumulate small changes. Eventually, they will be different enough so that they are no longer able to interbreed. That doesn't mean one group automatically has to die so we remain at the same number of species.Of course, one group might get some significant advantage which allows it to come back and ownzor the original area so the other group gets wiped out."
notsarc,No baby is more precious than another as far as my personal beliefs go it is no more alright to terminate a baby concieved through rape/incest than it is to terminate a baby classed as a mistake/inconvenience.
notsarc,"So, you're saying that you believe in absolutely everything your church believes and you support everything it does and the moment it did anything oustide of these you'd leave right?"
notsarc,"It is disappointing that you would continue with this mistake. I said that God is both knowable and unknowable. You simply think that equates to the same thing, and thus you argue against what you believe I say, rather than what I said."
notsarc,"No, I think you're trying to do more than that. You're trying to say that the increase in crime is due to a lack of gun ownership, aren't you? Because if you are, the article you cite doesn't back up that claim.   What, no actual data to back up any of your claims? Do you have access to US crime numbers? How many armed breakins do you get in a country where people do have guns? That's the comparison that needs to be made here."
notsarc,"It depends on your intention and your methods. Of course, things that don't have some sort of physical manifestation that can be measured can't be studied by science. Science is naturalistic. Scientific data can only include that which can be observed and quantified by natural means. I read it in a book of mythology isn't scientific."
notsarc,"Actually, you gave (and misspelled) one of the common names given to the fossil, ""Turkana Boy"" It is also sometimes called ""Nariokotome Boy"". But the real designation of the fossil is KNM-WT 15000 and any knowledgeable discussion of that fossil will refer to it as such. That fact, by the way, is how I know that Turkana Boy and Nariokotome Boy are one and the same fossil."
notsarc,"Archie is NOT right - he has an opinion, as we all do. Pro-lifers seem to want the definition of human with attendant rights to begin at conception. The blastocyst is now turning into a tumour. So the pro-lifers can now alter their views on what constitutes 'human' as and when it suits their purpose.Forget the emotive view of what an embryo/foetus looks like: some think that as long as it has appendages and looks human, then it IS. It isn't. It's still a parasitic organism dependant on the host mother. You can't deny that.Contraception v. abortion is a separate issue: in the meantime, the host mother should be the final arbiter of what happens to her body."
notsarc,Old news. There have been accusations of similar stories for years.
notsarc,"What if the surgery for transferring the embryo/fetus would be equal in difficulty, risk, etc. to having an abortion? There would then be no extra physical cost incurred in keeping the embryo/fetus alive. What would be the reasons, in such a case, to keep abortion as an option?"
notsarc,Marriage is a secular condition set up by various Societies over the millenia and one of the prerequisites set out is that such a union should be between people of different genders.Religion has supported this and sanctified it but did not invent it.You don't curse the Church you lobby Society to see if you can effect a change. People who believe the different gender aspect are entitled to lobby for no change.
notsarc,Same in the US. The father does not have the right to choose.
notsarc,"And people say I make strawman arguments.Simply put, not enough to justify your ""concerns""."
notsarc,"For anti-choicers, it's just about control and power over women. They don't care about life. (Except their own.)This same mother could be a person who didn't have access to pre-natal care. They wouldn't defend that right either.Because they DON'T care about the fetus. They don't care about life. They don't care about health. They care about power and money and pushing people around. That's all."
notsarc,"Very sad news. I'm gonna have to say that if I was talking to the assemblyman that they quoted said that to my face, I'd tell the little bigot that his filthy viewpoint sounds exactly like the arguments used against interracial marriage, against civil rights for blacks, women, and various minorities, and also against ending slavery."
notsarc,"So if an atheist believes that humans are the highest form of intelligence, and a devout Christian believes God is the highest form of intelligence, the Christian should allow the atheist to force him to behave as if humans are the highest form of intelligence?"
notsarc,"How about getting the government out of marriage entirely? That is the goal of the libertarians, and maybe the liberals. No standards would be redefined if that happened, and gays would get their right to marry."
notsarc,"I believe that's true, and as a ""believer"" (creationist), here is what is hard to understand about that; In Matthew, 12:30, Jesus says ""He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters"". It is safe to say that both creationists and theistic evolutionists would accept that statement from Jesus, and would seek to be ""with"" him, while agnostic and atheists would consider themselves ""not with"" him. Yet theistic evolutionists are comfortable to (usually politically) be ""with"" agnostics and atheists, and separate themselves from creationists. If they're genuine Christians, knowing about the warnings in the Bible about false teachings, how can they be comfortable with that?Miller laments in several places throughout the book that atheists use evolution as a weapon against religion, and that it shouldn't be that way - that it causes more strife between the two than should exist. "
notsarc,"Well, it showed how it was physically possible to generate amino acids from inorganic material. That's rather impressive. Again, irrelevant and unrelated to the Scientific theory of Evolution, regardless of you trying to create that association. Your continued attempt at doing so despite having been shown and told multiple times that the two are unrelated, well that only shows one thing, namely that you are dishonest."
notsarc,"Oh shut up! You're just sore because your side lost in the McDonald case and now you're left with absolutely nothing. You know that many gun laws are going to fall to the sword of justice, and you just can't stand the fact that your side is going to be brought back into check, just like any other."
notsarc,"The big bang, life from non-life, the progression of life from the simple to the complex, just to name a few. None of these can be proved (even on the balance of probabilities) to be true by operations science. All of these contradict scientific observations of the present. As a result, you must take them by purely blind faith."
notsarc,"I suspect that you are thinking of birds. But early birds had fingered claws on those wings. It is generally true that no organ ever springs into existance completely developed where nothing existed before. The wings of bats, birds, and pterodactyls are merely the modified fore-limb of a tetrapod. There is evidence that insect wings may have arisen from some sort of thermal panel. And of course, size has considerable relevance to flight. Wingless spiders fly by spinning a loop of silk that is carried by the moving air. Very small insects require almost no wings to fly. What they do is more similar to a whale in water than a bird in air. If by chance, a small animal is upsized because of a competetive advantage, and the wings are too, then it becomes a larger flying animal."
notsarc,"The tactics pro-lifers use make the Nazis look like the little league. I mean, seriously. The reason we are dealing with terrorism is because women have the right to the abortion procedure. Wow. Please give me one way those two things relate to each other."
notsarc,"I'm talking about the woman, of course. The fetus does not have a positive right to suck nutrients out of the woman's body against her will."
notsarc,"Well, not completely, but yes, quite the same. However, this is irrelivent- she wasn't a person, because she was in a coma. Does that give me the right to kill her? Of course not!   What about fetuses born in comas? Can we kill them?   What about people in vegetative states? After all, they arn't perfect, so let's kill them!"
notsarc,"So what?? Who cares what the number of assumptions are? What we care about is whether the idea is correct. And to determine whether it is correct, you have to have data, not counting assumptions."
notsarc,Well I'm not arguing that this is adaptation...I have never said that.. What I am saying is the environment -- in this case diet is the cause for these traits to emerge in offspring.....but like I said earlier ToE does not admit that the diet or any enviornmental variable can influence traits in offspring. Traits are dictated by genes and genes are closed off from the enviornment. This is the basic dogma of Weismann's barrier. I'm not necessarily calling this evolution....I'm just simply pointing out that acquired traits can be inherited. There is no other way to describe this other than Lamarckism. Do you disagree that The inheritance of acquired characteristics is simply changes in physiology acquired over the life of an organism that are transmitted to offspring?
notsarc,"What laws are these that you speak of? Kindly provide the bill name and number so you have some actual proof and aren't simply parroting from the fear-mongering Brady Campaign and Violence Policy Center.During World War II the American people rounded up Japanese-Americans and herded them into concentration camps because you were at war with the people of Japan and thought that they were the sleeping enemy even though they had no proof. What you're speaking of is no different than this.The way I see it Brady, your hatred for guns and gun owners is so overwhelming and logic defying, that you'd be perfectly alright with unleashing a life-ending pandemic plague on the people of earth if you believed it would put an end to all gun owners everywhere."
notsarc,"Dealt with. Wolves and dogs share a genus, not a species. Along with coyotes and jackels. See above for lots of transitionals, also."
notsarc,Now everyone will know Marc was right all along--that there is an atheist science conspiracy.
notsarc,"How right you are to,and given the forum here, make it a crime to own to own a gun,well I think most of us are automatically criminals.It's like the signs you see...SHOPLIFTERS WILL BE PROSECUTED!lot a good they do.emoticonXBanghead,yeah know matter how illegal their will be crime."
notsarc,"You hear that cry...allowing gays to marry will cause the downfall of civilization...but you never hear ""how"" or ""why""? More Chicken Little ####."
notsarc,"So you refuse to engage in an informal debate on the topic, but you all of a sudden are itchin' for a formal debate? How about you make the challenge?"
notsarc,"That is a nice little pistol with lots of smack for only 11 onces. Also, I like DA automatics."
notsarc,The issue of whether or not gay marriage is a 'human' / 'civil' right is begging the question ...
notsarc,It isn't offered to make that assertion at all. It is offered to show that God values the life of the unborn if He will demand that a man responsible for causing its death in the womb be held accountable by paying the ultimate price.
notsarc,"Well, I didn't really mean to go that far. But I'm talking about problems like that all worked out, thought about previously, and that the problem was worked out. I'm talking more about, what if you could make laborers stronger, scientists smarter, and rid us of physical and mental abnormalities ( such as down syndrome, narcolepsy, etc.). I don't think of making everyone the same for that reason. I'm just saying, what if there was a way to better society without going overboard? If the problems were worked out, which I'm sure they will be, what would your moral view on it be?"
notsarc,"I suggested nothing. You are reading into this some thing that is absent. ""The nurse then informed me, if I had answered yes to any of the questions, I would have lost my concealed carry permit as it would have gone into my medical records and the VA would have reported it to Homeland Security. Looks like they are going after us vets."""
notsarc,"But even worse, even if there were some unknown mechanism to cause such movement, it would generate heat. The heat generated by the creation of the mountains of the world would be more than enough to reduce the entire surface to molten lava. Add to that the fact that the condensation of the ""vapor canopy"" would release enough heat to boil all of the water on earth. "
notsarc,"Oh no, I completely hit the point and exposed it for what it is. Your continuing to compare the ID concept to a flat earth belief proves my point even more. That and the fact that you referred to the flying spaghetti monster seven times in your last post."
notsarc,"Well, ""reasonable"" is clearly subjective... So the authors of the letter are practicly saying that any gun laws not interfering with the state militia would be permited according to the second amendment. But that gun laws obviously should be reasonable. But what reasonable is, is best left to the democratic will of the people. Or am I reading it wrong?"
notsarc,"In case you were wondering, no one here has missed the fact that you're trying to divert attention from the real issues by beating one minor issue into the ground."
notsarc,"Actually, my wife and I discuss evolution all the time. She's an evolutionary biologist. She did feel as if she had some duty to watch the show, just to stay on top of the sorts of things being said. She just has a low tolerance for willful stupidity. Which I totally understand. :)"
notsarc,"No Ted Kennedy is not a fundie but Vitter is. For God sake the pope is a nazi and a fundie.Marlene Elwell, the nazi *itch, who put the evil mariage amendment on the michigan ballot is a Roman Catholic also. If you are a christian and you believe in the suppression of homosexuality then you are a fundie and a christianist."
notsarc,"Even new Justice Sotomayor, who claimed she ruled by precedent will be bound by the Heller Decision if she remains true to her purported philosophy. The debate between Sui Juris and Res Judicia should no longer be an issue with the liberals on this RIGHT! It either applies to all or it applies to none which would result as Justice W.O. Douglas wrote: ""a revolution"". It is in the government's (federal especially) best interests to keep our soldiers employed in foreign countries. BTW, I think the court decision in Nunn vs. State of Georgia did the best summation of this right!"
notsarc,"Your claim is not supported in the least. If we look to the landmark abortion case Roe v. Wade, we find that it was not women seeking abortions that were punished, but the people who procured the abortion that were. It would be the same if abortion were again made illegal. To prove this, we need only to look at a recent abortion regulatory statute: the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act. Needless to say, there are far less doctors who perform abortions than there are women who seek them, and because it was not a problem executing abortion law prior to 1973, it likewise won't be a problem executing abortion law should abortion be made illegal again."
notsarc,If guns laws don't affect criminals then how do you explain the low rates of criminal gun use in nations like the UK?
notsarc,So it is claimed.   Tiahrt Amendment Facts | ProtectPolice.org   I've noticed a pattern. Pro-gun activists give lip service to the idea of enforcing the law and catching the bad guys while supporting legislation that actually makes it harder for law enforcement to do so. They send a mixed message. It's happened before such as when the NRA has lobbied Congress to reduce the budget of the ATF. How can reducing the budget of law enforcement help them do their job better? It gives us a clue to what the gun lobby's true motives are. Truly disturbing.
notsarc,You were crowing a bit. What I don't understand is why. How could you possibly be pleased by some strangers religious views. Would you have been pleased if he switched to liking broccoli? (Or disliking as the case may be)
notsarc,"Were they able to show a previously non-existing code that mutated on a gene somewhere and created this new enzyme activity? It sounds to me that this ""new"" enzymatic activity came from non-coding dna switching on a gene to produce it. That is what one would expect to find. ...*Two new enzyme activities, 6-aminohexanoate cyclic dimer hydrolase and 6-aminohexanoate dimer hydrolase, were detected inthe adapted strains.*... "
notsarc,"This is actually humorous coming from you who has absolutely no concept that you are a spiritual being, or the extra dimension of yourself which that reality means to you. In other words antonia, It is the epitome of self deceit to lie to oneself about who they are. And you define that darkness which is the great lie you represent so completely."
notsarc,"And we know this how? You complain about the 90% figure being erroneous and then make an unsupported statement like this?Furthermore, if Mexico is making an earnest attempt to smash the cartels and we're financing it in part, wouldn't we want to help reduce the weapons traffic flowing south into the cartel's arsenals?"
notsarc,"Well, it seems pretty evident that you have know idea of the meaning of the word theory when used in science."
notsarc,"Actually, it is a mutation. Just like the color of the fur is a mutation. Polar bear fur is not white, it is colorless. Moreover, it is hollow. That is another mutation. And Polar bears have longer legs than their closest relatives, the brown bears. They have smaller ears. None of the changes are caused by ""friction"".By the way, the webs between the toes of a Polar bear are very much like the webs between the toes of a duck.Adaptation is, by the way, evolution. I presume that is the word you meant to use. Adaptation is not adaption. You talk about the process as if it were adaption and then call it adaptation. In reality it is adaptation."
notsarc,"No it means that the genome operates in a more complex way than was previously believed. It does not mean that ""life is irreducibly complex"" since that term is not even sufficiently well defined to test the assertion. And given the scattering of information into many pieces I would say that more and more it looks like ""pieces that happen to be fitted together"". More and more like a complex kludge. Exactly what one might expect to find in an evolved system rather than a designed or deliberate or intentional one!"
notsarc,"It's been reported in the Telegraph as well as several other news outlets. Want to slander them as well or do you want to try to disprove their story based on its content. I suggest the former, because the University has already confirmed the authenticity of the e-mails and documents. emoticonXRolleyes"
notsarc,"Well survival of the fittest was not Darwins term- although he may of used it it the later editions of the Origin. The phase was actually coined by Herbert Spencer in 1851.Weiner could be forgiven for his statement- if he had read the first edition of the Origin (regarded as being the best version as it contains no responses to critiscsms that were levelled at the preceeding editions) he would not have come across it under Darwins name.It is moot really, as natural selection is the term that is used in this context today."
notsarc,"I think the currently popular belief is that time itself is limited. Space, time, energy, matter and laws all came into existence together. Of course that's impossible for us to envisage...."
notsarc,You don't beleive that it is possible to do something wrong to prevent a larger number of wrongs in the future? Do you think the ends can ever justify the means?
notsarc,No you haven't. You expressed your opinion but refuted nothing.
notsarc,"Again, it's not just 'evidence' but 'evidence constructed into a workable theory'."
notsarc,"And yet this is what they fossil record shows. There is alot of information floating around on the uses of feathers for insulation, hunting techniques, display etc before flight.Half a feather might not be as good for flight as a ""fully developed"" one, but dinosaurs had them and they probably were able to glide, albeit poorly, with them. Even less of a feather might shade a pool of water to allow them to spot small fish or for display to attract a potential mate. To say they were ""totally useless"", is simply false. Evolution works on adapting already functional structures for different functions."
notsarc,I don't see why it is so hard to accept he lied. He lost is award and lost his job over his data.
notsarc,Do you mean someone who was wrong? I asked you before to give an example of where Newton found empirical evidence of God. You failed to do so. I suspect that you can't.
notsarc,"I see a subtle distinction here. Creationism is concerned with the spiritual origins of people. ""Evolutionism"" is entirely concerned with explaining the nature and history of the physical world. The conflict of opinion arises out of the importance of the detail- can Genesis be accepted as a parable which contains a fundemental truth or must it be taken as a historical account?"
notsarc,"You answered the first one already... it is a 'cartoon'. It showed that just as one was out-lawed, the other was born. You decide what to believe from this.By the way...""Lockheed Martin is a global leader in the design, development and production of missiles and missile defense solutions for the United States and its allies around the world. The goal: Defend against attacks by ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and other airborne threats.""http://www.lockheedmartin.com/wms/fi...=0&ti=0&sc=400"
notsarc,Oh never mind that such a condition would be toxic...not to mention that no ice cores support such magical ideas.
notsarc,"I'm not moving the goal posts, this is just your attempt at intellectual dishonesty. Heller was about an individual right protected in the Constitution, Dred Scott wasn't. Therefore these two cases aren't comparable anymore than cotton candy and scrap metal."
notsarc,"And what evidence do you have that having two gay parents would confuse a child about weahter they should be gay? Did you know that the same percentage of children that were brought up by gay couples turn out to be gay as children who are brought up by straight couples? I would say that destroys your conception that the kid would be confused.I know a number of people who were brought up by commited gay couples (admittedly not many), and not one of the ones I know turned out to be gay."
notsarc,"One shouldn't assume ignorance on the part of creationists. That is a mistake that too many evolutionists make.   In the real world, we have people willing to say things they already know isn't true. Why should creationists be any different? After all, they are people, too. But rather than accept that fact, evolutionists argue that creationists are ignorant of a subject when, in reality, they (creationists) were simply telling lies."
notsarc,So Minnesota is the one state Ohioprof was referring to?
notsarc,"Well, all I can say then is that no action is just about as bad as failed action, and IS as bad in terms of anything current. Either way you don't have gay marriage. You have a majority in Congress right now, and you're not demanding much change just because of fear of backlash? Yeah, there would be backlash. Heck, the Civil War was the ultimate backlash, but that didn't stop abolitionists from demanding more than TOKEN change, and it's a good thing they did. It's your gig, though, so do what you want. I don't see much point in laboring this discussion any more; I'm just pointing out my observations."
notsarc,When was the last mass murder at a UK university then?
notsarc,"Atheism doesn't have that standard because it's not that encompassing a thought. All athiesm is, is a lack of theism, period. It says nothing about morals or ethics. Your typical athiest, though, looks within to find what's moral or ethical and it usually just stems from what's acceptable behavior within the human species. This is also where religion gets its morality and ethics. But times change, and eating shellfish won't kill you, and eating meat on friday won't make the farmers go broke, so the morals and ethics change to fit the society."
notsarc,"But Miller is with Jesus (and by extension, you): he says that God exists and that Christianity is true. Or, if you insist that he's against you, you're left with this conundrum: You call Miller and theistic evolutionists incorrect, and he calls you and anti-evolutionists incorrect; why is your position any more logical than his?Regarding your citation about atheists using evolutionary findings to support their concepts, you omit the remainder of the paragraph. Shame on you, marc, for your quote mine. Miller clearly continues with ""philosophical pronouncements"" that many atheists do not forward. Over the following three paragraphs, he examines a single philosophical insinuation -- not a plethora of them -- and then moves beyond ""atheistic philosophical pronouncements."""
notsarc,"Actually there are already a couple floating around. One fascinating one: Gaia theory and the Daisyworld model. It's all around self-organising systems and the earth as a self-regulating system/organsism/something or other. James Lovelock and co. Interesting to read but sometimes feels a little too 'lets-all-just-get-along' to be real, hard-core theory. Either way, it's probably a lot more likely to be accepted than creationism, should evolutionism for some reason be disproved."
notsarc,"Quite frankly, you don't know squat about me. So stop trying to pretend you do.I have gone on record to say I think Christianity does a lot of good in the world.I have even tried to correct Matthew in his anti-Christian tirades.

notsarc,"Falling, the fact that the homeschoolers you mentioned don't choose to socialize with you, doesn't mean they're not far more capable of functioning in the ""REAL WORLD"" than you might think. I would not choose to socialize with you in the ""REAL WORLD"", and you most likely would not choose to socialize with me, but that does not make me your social inferior!"
notsarc,Because? The conventional big bang is just as unlikely as God. Therefore your claim is wrong.   However the current believe mainly among physicists and astronomers is that there is no end and there is no beginning to the universe. Expansionary theories along with contractionary theories that are being observed have led many to believe that the current universe was born from the death of the last universe. There is no end and there is no beginning.   You are out of your league.
notsarc,You are very right. We too will have to pay tax on the insurance for me. Not fair.
notsarc,"There is no need for prey animals to grow a third or forth eye as a defense mechanism. Binocular vision works. Its balanced and can render 3d positioning in the mind accurately. The lizard that you mentioned is born with a spot sensitive to light which helps the body absorb vitamin d, as humans do due to skin that is light-sensitive to a certain extent. It isn't an eye for defending against predators, and it doesn't need one. As for insects, the fact that they've survived for such a long time goes to show that they have adapted adequately and are doing well. Have you tried sneaking up on a fly lately?"
notsarc,"I think perhaps you're confused.1. I know of no meaningful definion of the term ""god' as it pertains to reality.2. When you mention science and history, that implies you are interested in reality.3. There is no evidence to support mythological deities, god or God or Odin or the easter bunny.* So, yes THERE IS NO EVIDENCE of the existence of any mytholgoical gods.** Yes, there is no evidence that the universe was created, or if that statement even has meaning if the universe always was, and always will be.p.s. There is easter bunny.-Mach"
notsarc,"Well that may be your contention, but medically that is not necessarily true. Maybe being gay doesn't mean you are suicidal or depressed, but there is more of it going on in the gay life than in the hetero. That in itself is a wake up call. Depression and suicide are harmful, even if it doesn't touch you personally. If it were as simple as you say the APA wouldn't be re-evaluating ""reorientation therapies"" would they and with positive critiques too. You wouldn't have prominent gay activists like Camile Paglia deriding the gay community for being malcontent when those unhappy with being gay seek and desire the way to be hetero."

notsarc,"So what you are saying is simply that the genes do not actively control the body.What is wrong with assuming that genes therefore do not control the body is the fact that the genes were the blueprint for the body. The genes decided the arrangement of cells, the number of fingers, etc.The body, the cells, and the organelles within the cells are therefore strongly influenced by the DNA sequence."
notsarc,"Why didn't they ""fire"" and ""bar"" him in the sixties?"
notsarc,"Actually, creation explains nothing. Evolution is an observation that is explained by theories that explain why populations of animals change. One explanation is the theory of natural selection."
notsarc,it can't always be cared by anyone. What if no one wants the baby or you can't get to a place where you can give the baby up (maybe snowed in for a week). Can you kill the baby then because it is now dependent on you.
notsarc,"Well of course it's about petitions that would lead to amendments. What else would it be about? Nevertheless it is still a voting process. That's how amendments are done. What I'm asking is, does this bill mean that ANY issue that could come up as an amendment would be illegal? And if not, (the more important question) how would they determine what constitutes civil rights. (Which you didn't answer, but rather basically said 'I don't know but rest assured they do' (to paraphrase). Get it now? Anyway, on further review, I believe that the bills only apply to whatever falls under the catagory of 'civil rights', however the heck that is to be determined! emoticonXDonno "
notsarc,"Too late, drug usage has already created those epidemics. Legalizing drugs may increase some of them temporarily, but they already exist. I would argue that there would be a decrease in crime, for certain."
notsarc,Not at all. The theory of evolution contains many many things.
notsarc,Evolutionary scientists is a confusing term. A geochronologist might work out an age for a lava sample for example. Astronomers have also made comment on the age of the earth as have paleontologists studying certain fossils.So why would no flood make radiometric much more likely to accurate as you say? Can we hear some specific detail on this as it is kinda significant to backing you your assumption.

notsarc,"Your statment is like saying we evented 2+2= 4. We did not envent it, it aways existed. Same with logic, its a concept that exists apart from the meterial universe. But in the atheists worldview, only the meterial universe exists."
notsarc,"See above. Nothing has been demonstrated that convinces me that God has been ruled out of all these issues. He probably isn't active in all situations, but there's nothing that says he (or even Satan) are totally inconsequential either."
notsarc,Homo-erectus and Neandertals had different bone structures. How could they be fully human when their anatomy is fundementally different?
notsarc,A little of both. Japan is known for allowing its police officers to physically and mentally torture suspects and deny them legal counsel if they determine that such counsel will interfere with their interrogation. Suspects aren't allowed to read confessions before signing them either.Is that what Penfold really wants?
notsarc,BUt it comes down to gay people being harmed by not being allowed to marry. Any time a group is excluded because of someone elses religious beliefs that group is harmed.
notsarc,The process of evolution has no scientifically known teleology and follows no known predestined plan. It does not teach that there cannot be any such things as teleology or forethought. This is where your mistake lies.
notsarc,"No-one experiences the existence of an outside world. Explanations such as the Matrix can explain sense impressions as well as some concept of 'external reality'. We have no more evidence for one than the other.The fact no-one takes them seriously is a psychological point about human beings, nothing to do with reality per se."
notsarc,Recent comparisons between the complete chimp genome and the human genome have found that possibly fewer than 3 million nucleotide differences exist in functional DNA.
notsarc,"Actually, the fossil record does support it. Both Eldredge and Gould have discussed it. Both men made observations of slow gradual speciation in the fossil record in a small geographical area. These changes were reflected at other locations as an abrupt change from one species to another. But given that such changes take place very quickly in populations that are usually under environmental stress and isolated from the main population, and given the rarity of fossilization in the first place, we don't expect to find many examples in the fossil record. It is a bit like trying to time a 100 yd. dash with a sundial. The fossil record just isn't fine grained enough to see the rapid (50-60 thousand years) changes."
notsarc,"The VAST majority of abortions are performed within the first trimester. When they are performed in the second trimester it's a serious procedure for the mother to go through, and is something she obviously wouldn't go into lightly. Her reasons for choosing an abortion as late as that would have to far outweigh anything else, and she would need consent from two doctors to go ahead with it. Basically what I'm trying to say is something like the foetus being developed enough to feel pain would not change the mind of a woman who had just found out she was pregnant and she'd been raped, or was going through something you can't understand. For an abortion that late she'd have to deliver the foetus anyway, which is traumatising enough. "

notsarc,"Well, there is now string theory, which has grown into M-theory, which may have a rational answer (at least a mathematical one). But calling it a theory is really a misnomer. It's more like a hypothetical model.But, do you have a rational explanation for the Big Bang?Or do you think that the Big Bang didn't happen?"
notsarc,"Actually I'm so sure of my manhood that even though I knew that charge would be levelled against me I still posted anyway. Anyway if you feel that men need to be degraded to make up for past actions to women you have gone from ""righteous"" to bitter."
notsarc,"Nope. And since the melanic form is the dominant allele, your point is moot."
notsarc,"So the intent hiding behind abortion laws all along was to keep women in the gutter. There was not any legititamte concern for the unborn fetus. It was all about how they could keep women down. Tell me then, would someone who supports a ban on partial birth abortion do so simply because they want to repress women?"
notsarc,GREED but what you fail to admit is that that standard of living comes at a price for someone.
notsarc,"think of it as a photocopy of a check for a million dollars. yes the copy is in the image and likeness of the original check, but it is not the check. you cannot cash the photocopy, regardless of how accurate the copy is, it is not the check, only an image of it. that doesn't mean anything is ""wrong"" with the original, and it doesnt mean that the copy has to have all the properties and function of the original. its just an image"
notsarc,"My life was a gift from my parents, no more, no less. When i look in the mirror, i do not see an embryo. If someone gives you something, they have every right to take it away if they feel you are not suited to handle it, or if they had second thoughts. I would think this was ok if the baby was stopped in an earlier stage, but once its in its third trimester, you have no right to kill it."
notsarc,"Sucide? Isn't that a mental health issue? If you take a gun from a sucidal and depressed person, does that cure depression?   If it does that you have addressed the root cause of sucide.   If it does not than you really have not done anything to cure the fundamental cause of sucide."
notsarc,"Yes, it is interesting how we draw an arbitary ""legal line in the sand"" with regards to determining how late into a pregnancy an elective abortion is available."
notsarc,"I think bringing ""emotions"" into the question of whether God exists or not tends to cloud the issue a bit.Isn't the essence of atheism a rational enquiry which concludes that in the absence of any credible evidence, there is no reason to believe in God ? An emotional attachment to ""non-belief"" would be irrelevant (and irrational)."
notsarc,"I don't see anyone without healthcare. None of my friends, none of my family, none of my neighbors. ZILCH. NADA. NAUGHT. CIPHER.   Now I don't go wandering around the inner cities looking for half-crazy winos and crack addicts either, so maybe that's why."
notsarc,pro-choice is only pro child if the choice is not abortion and they are only pro family when the choice for family. So really pro choice can be pro child or anti child and pro family or anti family.

notsarc,"And that part of the decision (not allowing for the woman's health to be taken into account) is why I do not agree with nor do applaud this decision (in fact I am rather disgusted with it).

notsarc,"The egyptians predicted his birth, death, WWI, WWII, and they have predict the supposed end of the world. Are you saying that this religion was wrong? They predicted a lot more that I have not put that have come true."
notsarc,I know ... I know. I agree with you that it's sad more of those people couldn't or didn't take advantage of concealed carry to help prevent so many deaths. That needs to change along with education so more people can defend themselves.
notsarc,"Actually, that's not true. While all of the sciences actually support one another, one can be a chemist and not accept evolution. One can even do good science without accepting evolution, but it is difficult. For example, cosmology, astrophysics and astronomy see a very old universe. That's not compatible with young earth creationism. Geology finds an old earth, wich isn't compatible with the mythologies of sacred writings. But that is not to say that one cannot be a qualified scientist and a deist or a theist. There are lots of good Christian scientists who accept evolution."
notsarc,"Actually JP so far 5 states have passed gay marriage so no not every time it is put to a vote do we lose.And how am I forcing anyone to accept gay marriage? Am I forcing these voters to attend my wedding or dare I say be in a marriage themselves?And I cannot agree with you more about changing the image of the gay community as a whole.. We are not all a bunch of promiscuous sex crazed people running around...What I find funny is once strait people find out how boring we really are, and how we pay taxes just like every other joe schmo they'll think nothing more of special rights lol...But actually like I stated earlier in another thread if those unions constituted the same legal rights as married couples I would be content."
notsarc,"Could you perhaps define ""teleology"" as you understand it and say why you believe there is teleology in the universe?"
notsarc,"I think your idea has merit. However, before I would fully endorse it, I am interested in how you see it being implemented and administered from the standpoint of equal protection under the law."
notsarc,"I know what you mean. You should see some of the other ""books"" he has at his site as well.Well, now we know that Muslim creationists are even nuttier than Christian creationists, but both still use the same twisted ideas and concepts to justify their pseudo-science of creationism (Read: Religious beliefs). ;)"

notsarc,"Actually, this guy was an ex-con. It's illegal for a convicted felon to own firearms. Galileo actually helped us more than he helped you. This proves once again that criminals will always refuse to surrender their weapons."
notsarc,And an even funnier thing is it won't affect his wallet at all.
notsarc,I know that. I asked those questions to show how dumb and ridiculous unkerpaulies question was - took it to other examples where such a question is obviously ridiculous to illustrate the ridiculousness of his question.
notsarc,"To be more accurate, (not something noted amongst the pro-gun rabble) the right of protestants to have arms for their defence against catholics.I think we've all seen quite enough of this ""defence"" in Northern Ireland.

notsarc,"How is that conclusion derived at? The passage is speaking to the consequences to a man who's actions cause the death of an unborn child. And the proscribed consequence is death according to OT Law. So although the passage isn't speaking to abortion at all, it is making a very clear statement regarding the value of the unborn, as it is requiring a life for a life just as for any other sentient being according to the OT Law. So these arguments I get from the likes of you and Iangb which argue that until a child shows mental awareness, it isn't actually a person deserving of human rights is a bogus and shortsighted position according to the scriptural point of view. Of that, there is no question."

notsarc,"What's ""cumulative selection?"" Do you mean a series of mutations with small but beneficial influence that occur over the period of thousands or millions of years? Just how do you propose to observe such mutations? In fact, we can observe such mutations by comparing the genomes of related species."
notsarc,"You bring up a very interesting point.   All those state level marriage amendments which were voted on also made civil unions illegal as well. When polled, residents in those areas were actually unaware that the amendments also outlawed civil unions.   So, not only are the anti's disingenuous as far as what they promoted, but were so in HOW these amendments were promoted."
notsarc,"Because we view it as something much more than just a gravy train from the govt., that's why.For you it seems to be about the word, and the govt. saying ""oh, you use THAT term (""marriage""), ok we recognize it."" For us it's about the commitment."
notsarc,"Well yes, but thats not what DEFECTIVE GULO indicates. If one has external sources of vitamin C, GULO can mutate to be inactive without causing a problem, and once inactive the inactive gene can be inherited without causing problems so long as vitamin C intake is high enough. An inactive GULO indicates that the species has external sources of vitamin C which is essential to many metabolic processes."
notsarc,"You are missing the entire point (again). Why do you feel ashamed? Because you know that what you did is bad. I have heard from a great Australian war hero, one of our remaining ANZACs soliders (recently passed away I think) that we he stabbed the enemy soldier with the spike thing on the end of their gun (WWI era) and he saw him die that it was ""the worst feeling that a human can possibly endure"". He said that that image will haunt him for the rest of his life. He knows that he did something wrong, but it was a war, and unfortuantely that kind of thing will happen. You are way off the plot. But let us continue."
notsarc,They are not exactly the same. See the examples above. It is not random.
notsarc,"I agree it's a threat to us but the point is whether it's really caused by increaing amount of carbon dioxide and how big the threat is.Maybe global warming is just a part of process of global climate change which occured several times long time ago, ie, ice age things like that.As far as I know, global warming is one of the catastrophe which leads to extinction of human beings. However, there might be another problems which are also big threat to us and all creatures on the earth.Anyway, I'm not an expert of environment, so I might be wrong but at least I can say it seems there are some bad effetcts of global warming such as rising sea level, abnormal climate pattern, things like that.We should do something, which might not be appropriate way to solve the problem but it's surely the beginning."
notsarc,"Well, the slavery analogy for gay rights is past it's applicability at this point--one was a property issue (also rooted in deep prejudice), the other is a morality issue. Many people oppose gay marriage out of morality and NOT prejudice. The same can't be said for slavery. There are many ways that the analogy doesn't work and that's just one of them. In fact, it could as easily be an analogy to reverse it and say that the ones who did the enslaving were analogous to gay rights lobbyists and the abolitionists were analogous to those who seek to protect marriage. After all, the plantation owners were the ones really fighting for ill-conceived rights--rights that they shouldn't have had. "
notsarc,"Funny. That's not what the articles say. All of the articles pretty much concentrate on the research as significant in support of the dinosaur/bird link. If you had been paying attention, you would have been aware that it had been previously established through other tests that protein remnants were present. Thus, the amazement that protein remnants so old had been found had already passed."
notsarc,I have noticed he seems content to drop a Ad Hominem neglecting to actually argue.
notsarc,"Again, they must be alive. Previously, you submitted that there are many problems with society and life or whatever. Could it be that some people might be able to survive those problems? Could it be that those survivors would be the ones to reproduce?"
notsarc,"Nope. Frame-shifts move the whole code down one step, making entirely new genes. Often, this is disastrous, but sometimes, a useful new enzyme results.Barbarian observes:It's remarkable then, how much progress we've made. You may or may not approve of the theory, but it works very well at learning more about biology.And, as you may have noticed, we've been very successful at interpreting the data. We've learned to do a lot of things as a result. One of the most important reasons scientists accept the theory is that it works."
notsarc,"And what exactly am i granting to the suit-wearing politicians in washington by giving them the right to revoke her ability to make these decisions for herself? I don't think dictatorship is the right word, since she is not asking for the power over anyone but herself, and her child. Would you call a man dying of inoperable cancer who decides to end his chemotherapy a dictator? Or a parent who decides to remove their child from life-support?Would you rather it be a democracy? That everytime a woman is faed with this predicament, we put it to a vote? How about an oligarchy- where her situation is put in front of some committee who decides her fate?"
notsarc,"And yet, even though creationists ask for detailed lists of every creature in transition over a period of several million years, I have never found a single creationist who can trace his ancestors back to Adam, a period of only about 6,000 years. The best I can do is to trace my ancestors back to the 1600s."
notsarc,"Oh? They're trained to deal with irate exhusbands who are stabbing their wives and dousing them in gasoline, in broad daylight, in the middle of a busy parking lot? They're trained to deal with that specific kind of #### every single day?"
notsarc,"Yes, but gays would also want laws changed to accomodate THEIR form of marriage as well. The fact that one requires less change than the other shouldn't matter, should it? Should having to do more reworking of laws and more paperwork hinder the pursuit of equality? It seems to me your argument boils down to ""polygamy requires more work to make the laws accomodate it."" Yeah--such is the price for marriage equality.Let's face it--if society really wanted to make marriage an open-ended institution of equality rather than for opposite-sex couples which comprise most relationships, they could pull it off--polygamy, gays, letting 17 year olds marry, etc. All those civil servants are there and can do it as directed as legislation is changed. Means could be set up to determine inheritance, for example. Laws can be worded to do it."
notsarc,"Since when were proteins no longer structures? A basic freshmen tool for teaching is the phrase ""structure defines function."""
notsarc,"Really? What a surprise! So tell me. If you don't know what it is or how it works, how do you know that you are opposed to it?"
notsarc,"Hardly any criminals go armed in England, and certainly not with guns. Burglars and muggers have enough sense to know that while getting done for burglary or mugging will not be pleasant, getting done for burglarly or mugging AND possession of a firearm will be far, far worse, assuming they survive the arrival of the armed response squad."
notsarc,"I think the only valid reason for owning a gun is because you want to. Every person (with some exceptions) has the right to keep and bear arms, why you do it is your own business. Giving specific reasons for gun ownership is the top of a slippery slope towards banning certain firearms.   While I have specific reasons for owning specific guns, to include hunting, I own some of my guns for no other reason than they are fun to shoot.   A humorus side note: I own one gun strictly for fishing, sounds odd but its common practice (at least in Alaska) to shoot large Halibut before bringing them aboard."
notsarc,"In my reading of the Declaration (and using the 1st. Amendment as a filter) it doesn't matter who or what the founders meant by ""Creator."" The conlusion is the same; regardless. Namely; The fact that the founders considered our basic rights to be inherrent."

notsarc,What is incredible is that this is probably the most enlightened response I can expect from this crowd.

notsarc,"But it took a lot longer to develop. My point was that only after about 5000 years of human civilization did empiricism as science develop. Religion, supernaturalism, and mythology trace back into prehistory. What we know as science didn't even begin to exist until the late 1500s and 1600s. Before that it was OK to do science like Aristotle did - no experiment, only thinking about a logical answer. Thus, heavy objects fell faster than light ones and any fool could tell that the sun orbited the earth.But science is more than an inner way of thinking. It is a process and a method for learning about the universe. It is called methodological naturalism. That is not to say the science asserts that nothing exists except what is natural. It says that science can't study the supernatural."

notsarc,"They do it on purpose, alright. But not because it'll be shot down -- in at least one state, the Supreme Court decided that similar legislation did not address more than one issue.The reason they put them together is that, in most states, a ban on civil unions would FAIL."

One joint is said to contain more carcinogens than four tobacco cigarettes.I doubt your 20,000 joints theory.You have a simplistic argument going for pot. I can't agree that legalizing all drugs would be a good thing either. Programs in Holland have failed to produce significant if any benefits to society in general. The druggies seem to have benefitted by having arrest-free drug zones and access to whatever they want, but the cost of drugs still requires some income, something that most of them likely do not have other than from crime, begging or social programs.One ""benefit"" I see from legalizing drugs is that the users could be more easily identified."

She is serving life in prison -- as is Mr. Ridgway.I also find the comparisons that Cybererratus makes to be morally troubling."

notsarc,Exactly and if you accept that animals have been on the Earth for millions of years then why can't evolution be a process that God created and controls?
notsarc,"Actually, one. After the adoptions years ago, we hit the financial slump and had a suprise... The costs will extremely low. I've also been in discussion with numerous friends who've delivered, same story. Somehow, no matter how there is no money and no help, babies get born.

notsarc,This is absurdity. I suppose then that medicine should wreak my body. How about viruses? Am I destroyed by them?
notsarc,"So what is your point? Are you claiming that the tenets of christianity are in doubt because the several thousand denominations hold contradictory views? Science proceeds by challenges and contradictions. Contradiction in science is not evidence of doubt but evidence of a field of advance. In religion, it is without question, a matter of the veracity of the ultimate truth. Which of the thousands of christian faiths hold the truth?"

notsarc,"Well, what faults? You say that innocent people are sentenced to death far too often. Well, the death penalty does not sentence people, our judiciary system does. The death penalty is mearly a punishment. I will agree that some innocent people have been sent to death row, and when their innocence was discovered, they were released. A perfect judiciary system would not sentence innocent people, and would alleviate all problems with the death penalty. If we had a perfect system and no innocent person was ever sent to death row, we could take them directy from sentencing to a little room beside the courtroom containing a bed and a few drugs, put an IV in them, and carry out the sentence before the jurors got out of the courthouse. Of course, we know that our judiciary system is an imperfect thing, so we understand the need for appeals. "
notsarc,"Actually, the Mormon seminaries aren't ""on the grounds,"" although they may be on an adjacent, privately owned piece of property.

Board of Education (333 U.S. 203)Zorach v.

notsarc,"Well, I can't speak for anyone else, but I support any choice that the woman wants to make. No, I don't support forced abortions anywhere, I don't support what's going on in China and India because they're still taking a choice away from the women.What I don't get is that many prolifers think that prochoicers are ONLY for the choice of abortion. All the prochoicers I know support any choice the woman feels right about making. For example, I was called a hypocrite because I'm prochoice and pregnant. The person said ""You're forcing others to abort while you carry to term."" I have NEVER forced anyone to do anything, nor will I ever. I've also never aborted...and many prolifers automatically assume that if one is prochoice they've aborted."

Anyhow, not all jokes are completely true, how many stand up comedians have you heard??? If you were to nit pick every joke out there (being politicaly correct etc) there would be no jokes left!"
notsarc,"What would you know about fair and balanced?emoticonXCensoredI know a lot of truths about gays. Do you want me to start posting incessant threads pointing them all out?And I am the moderator for the formal debate forum, not the entire board. Want to debate me on the benefits of gays on society vs Christianity?"
notsarc,"Actually, if you look at the example I've given, that's false. The probability of A in one organism may be low, but the probability of A in some organism approaches 100% as the population and the number of generations gets larger. And if A is useful and comes to dominate the population, then the probability of an AB individual appearing then also tends towards 100%. In the example above, the chance of an AB mutant occurring, if A and B are substantially useful mutations, is almost a dead certainty. It would be amazing if they didn't stack. So saying that AB occurring is less likely than A is misleading at best, downright wrong at worst. Behe is clearly misapplying probability theory."
notsarc,Actually Archie it was neither left nor right. he went after both democrat and republican and took a center tone to the entire issue at hand. Portraying the reality of the suffering of his hometown due to jobs leaving the US and the greed on wall street.
notsarc,That is what it said. Now your website gives a false translation to this. It clearly is talking about if the unborn is harmed.Not to mention the numerous other quotes I gave you about how a person (in the Christian faith) is formed before conception! This shows that God has already created you. God also talks about how you can't kill a person he created. This is an easy concept to follow.I suggest if you wish to learn what the Bible says you read it and not take what a biased website has to say. Religioustolerance.org is a joke that misleads people into making God what they want him to be.
notsarc,I think you are the same person as usa all the way and again.. you have no right to talk about murder because you murder the english language everytime you post.And no.. the baby does not belong to god because there is no baby and I don't know if there is a god or not. Btw.. I'm not going to incubate something in my body because of you think it's wrong because someone who may or may not exist said so.
notsarc,And I see you still flip back and fourth from being an atheist to not being an atheist.
notsarc,"Those who set the rules can do with them as they please. It isn't illogical nor hypocritical. It IS illogical to assume you can chew gum if the rule is ""you cant chew gum"" and the teacher allows one student to chew gum."
notsarc,"Pandion has already pointed out that this isn't a theory, it's a mode of wishful thinking. More damagingly, however, if you examine it for more than a moment it doesn't even fulfill the role you give it. You say 'many things in nature make no sense without God', but how do god's origins and nature make sense? Where did he/she/it spring from? All you do by invoking god as an 'explanation' is push the problems one step further back. The god hypothesis may look like an explanation, but it is not."
notsarc,"And here you reveal your prediliction for reading what you want to see into the words of others. I described materialism embracing new forces and phenomena which have withstood the rigors of the scientific method. I explicitly described science as a methodology, not a philosophy. You are wrong about me, WW, and the longer you pretend otherwise, the more time you're going to waste on strawmen and the more chances I'm going to get to make your arguments look silly. It's up to you. Argue with me, or argue with the person you want me to be."
notsarc,"oh yeahrubbish rubbish,scientifically speaking, human life (using a most bsic term) begins at conception. the twins exist as two seperate entities the moment each contains the individual human dna. seems to me you better be certain when it begins before you go around ending it. if you are driving at night an you ""think"" you might see a person ahead in the middle of the road you are hopefully not gonna drive over that person. Instead that uncertainty should lead you to stop. If you dont like that example, consider a hunter who is unsure what is in the bushes."
notsarc,Sounds pretty neat. I've never been there but I'll keep it in mind for a road trip some time.So you are of the belief that dinosaurs and man lived at the same time? I know that there are people who believe in this but I don't come across them very often. So what information do you have to share with us about this idea?
notsarc,"Among other things, generally adaptions to a colder environment.    As for your theory as a whole, doesn't the whole 15, 000 year gap between the extinction of the Neanderthalls and the development of farming (particularly the grains youre talking about)."
notsarc,"So when you're doing math, you're an atheist? Of course not. Just because there is overlap doesn't mean that the two views are identical."
notsarc,"No one mentioned helping or not helping people here, or even dealing with the consquences of pregnancy at all. Its more;'If abortion were banned, what measures or research would you suggest to reduce the pressure for people to have illegal ones or unwanted pregnancies'."
notsarc,"Just like the Brady Campaign. Often when trying to paint concealed carry holders as dangerous individuals, most instances they cite either never had a concealed carry permit to begin with, or the matters of the case were instances that lacked mens-rea and weren't crimes to begin with."
notsarc,That's obviously not what is said. The sun's energy is not claimed to be a mechanism that makes order of disorder. What it does do is override the tendancy within the 2LoTD where total usable energy in a system decreases.
notsarc,"Can we get away from quoting 5 year old posts? Seriously, if you don't take the time to actually read the thread why should I respond to your post?"
notsarc,"They have changed. For example, ancient examples of coelacanth were shallow water species, while the modern coelacanth is a deep marine species (actually, two or three species). And the differences are enough to put them in different families.By the way, ark guy, what do you know about taxonomy?"
notsarc,"Logical truths do not come from ""somewhere"", your question makes as much sense as ""What time is a moose?"".You do not appear to have read my post at all, variously repeating what I have said and addressing things I did not say."
notsarc,Obviously that is the case. We cannot simply say that a certain God exists and have it be so.
notsarc,A taste of what could be our future if the left has its way.
notsarc,"What do you mean by other definitions? Before you stated ""Creation is...."" thus it is implicit in this that you are arguing against a single homogonous construct. And it's embarrassing for you to realise that there's actually as much variance of opinion in this, as in evolution."
notsarc,"Do you want to explain what you think the problem is? You're going to see a much larger change if you start fiddling with the controls than if you were replacing bases within the protein coding sequence - a lot of those wouldn't change anything in the protein, and a lot of the changes to the protein wouldn't have a significant effect either."
notsarc,And science helped Stenger write his book. How can the same subject make a stronger case for both of two completely opposing viewpoints?   another
notsarc,"That's certainly your right, but supersport is interested in hawking a religious agenda, not a scientific one. He may want it disguised as a scientific one, but a perusal of his posts here bely that desire."
notsarc,They do not. They offer increased thermal protection and thus make a greater range of habitats possible. Feathers also offer increased protection from attack. They are so good that several native American cultures were known to make armor from feathers. They absorb and spread impact quite well.Feathers don't itch and they don't rustle in the bush.Do you have an answers that aren't examples of shallow thinking?
notsarc,False and that doesn't invalide evolution given how it's a misrepresentation of one of the statements in the theory.       Gould can take his comments and shove them up his ***.
notsarc,"There are no objective reasons to condemn gays. Marriage is not a matter of state and so it is meaningless to argue whether a state should recognize it.My advocating of perfect liberty allows no contradictions or exceptions, believe me I have lost alot of support from conservatives for this, perhaps even gays if one really applied it to all extremes."
notsarc,"And only a ""miniscule and negligible fraction of the total wild moth population"" has even been observed resting anywhere else. Despite my explanation of his mathematical misleading, wabbit continues with it.Some of you with better short-term memory might remember that I stated that there is little debate that many of Kettlewell's experiments were imperfect. wabbit has posted some excerpts to this effect, but really, all we need to do here is realize that wabbit has quote mined to his little heart's content. Here's a portion he purposely excised:"
notsarc,"Some references please? In general, it seems that most climatologists agree that severe weather systems will occur more frequently with an increase in average global temperature. (ref:http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/061.htm#1434)"
notsarc,"This applies only when men strive...that is fight. If a man ""Accidently"" hits a woman while in a fight and causes her to lose her child then all he has to do is pay a fine. But if he keeps fighting and hurt other people he gets killed. Even in the Bible you dont get punished so severly on accidents."
notsarc,This is a push to promote lawlessness. The San Francisco fiasco is the prime example. People with certain agendas are refusing to follow the laws. This is a devastating precedent for our Nation.
notsarc,"With regard to this statement you have to consider:1. How can anyone know what product an ""intelligent designer"" wanted.2. Even from the example of life on Earth we can clearly see there is nothing easy at all about the path life has taken over the millenia.But I think it is possible to hold your position, although it can be a tricky one by virtue of the entrenchment of opinions that has occured in the religion science debate- due to the less than pragmatic attiudes of some of the participants."
notsarc,"Well, one person got it right...where in the constitution does it say something about health having to be protected?"
notsarc,"The value of logical reasoning is dependent upon your axioms. Highly religious people are no less capable of reasoning logically than anyone else - but the unshakeable axiom that their personal version of god really exists enters into every equation. For you, one axiom is the existence of Vitality; volition made quantifiable, and the other is that darwinian evolution must be wrong and worthless in every respect.There is no logical reason for you to deride NS the way you do; it's an integral part of any evolutionary theory that seeks to explain the big picture of how the organisms we see around us came to be; the occurrence of mutations, volitional or otherwise is not enough on its own. But your axioms prevent you from incorporating it into EAM and getting on with your life."
notsarc,"I think a more telling question would be, why the hell would you rather feel constantly threatened than feel safe? It seems completely idiotic to me.   Smiley"
notsarc,"Why can't you answer questions directly?anyway, I support ct in passing civil unions or marriage lite as I like to see it, but It doesn't confer equality. If it is really equ8al than it would be marrige. Reason beinbg portablity ( irealize you think that some day we might have that, but we don't so far and we cannot ccontrol other countries who may have gay marriage but not cilvil unions and may not recognize civil unions but recognize marriage.)If it is good for straight couples, it should be equally good for all couples. . No one is more superior. Everyone should be equal. Marriage for all is equals."
notsarc,"And then there's this:Alarm at routine patrols by armed police - Crime, UK - The Independent"
notsarc,"And depending on what human is ""finding the answers"" it can unfortunately cheapen and deny many central Biblical teachings."
notsarc,"That's good. You're right, all we can do is hope and pray (I pray for things like this every day, and in a way, God has answered my prayer in this case)."
notsarc,"And melting the entire surface of the earth and boiling the oceans. Even creationist who propose the nonsense that you spout admit that they have no way to explain where the heat went. In an effort to answer where the water went, they encounter the problem of explaining where the heat went."
notsarc,"You may have missed the context from the other thread I referred to.The point I made is that the unlikeliness of a Presidential signature did not stop Senator Obama from voting in favor of a required Iraq troop withdraw timetable. The promised veto threat didn't matter in this instance. He was ""standing on principle."" Well, same would apply for his newfound views disfavoring DOMA as well in my view."
notsarc,It hasn't been proven that the Second Amendment is solely about tyrannical governments and not about dealing with violent criminals.
notsarc,"You need to read what people say more thoroughly, and think about it before you respond. When he said ""can"" (and there are not many simpler words than that!) It didn't mean ""will"", ""must"", or ""shall"" be more aggressive. It has been shown that in some cases it ""CAN"" happen. It may not have happened with you. It still might, we don't know. We might even say that it is not likely to happen, but we can't say that it won't, because sometimes some people do behave more aggressively when they have a gun."
notsarc,And if someone had written an ad proclaiming that black Americans are inferior the same thing would have happened as well. I can't justify what they did but when you put such a hot-button issue out like that into the open...it has to be expected. People have strong feelings about abortion rights (just like racism) and it is naive to think something like this wasn't going to happen.
notsarc,"To point our an error, i believe the baby was at the infant stage, not the toddler."
notsarc,"There are precious few areas on the planet that have not been explored. Those that haven't would not support the kinds of life we are talking about. There is no evidence of any interim species of apes and humans. Not one shred. Those items in the fossil record that are claimed as possibles are only possibles, are dubious at best, and are extremely rare. A recent study also showed that most characteristics of supposed alternate species of hominids were well within the variation seen in current homo sapiens. The point I was making is that if they existed we would see them."
notsarc,"Well, it depends on your definition of retarded I guess. The standards to get a drivers license are really not that high. Think of how dumb the average person is, and realize that 50% of people are dumber than that. Kinda makes you cringe.   And you wonder what has prevented me from being in an accident? Well, perhaps the fact that I am a concientious, defensive, and skilled driver who excercises caution while on the road. Maybe next time someone pulls out in front of me, I should just throw my hands in the air and scream ""take the wheel jesus!"" I am sure some magical being will fly down from heaven and save me from crashing. Yeah...sure."
notsarc,I'll assume this is figurative since they do not literally melt.
notsarc,"It won't. I'd think any responsible parent with a teen under the age of 18 who has a sound relationship with that teen would discuss the possibility of her becoming sexually active (a normal function in spite of some puritan attitudes) and offer simple avoidance of possible pregnancy and abortion. Like vehicle insurance she may never need it, but going without either one is plain stupid."
notsarc,"Actually, the storm lasted for 40 days and 40 nights. The ark was actually afloat for a year or so. So I guess the answer is that the ark had all kinds of pestilent insects winging about and biting and stinging the occupants. The problem is, how did these aquatic breeders actually propagate in the feces and urine infested bilge of the ark?"
notsarc,"Again, you are the affirmative, you must support your claims. Please support the claim that we are using an atheist presupposition. I think we are using more an agnostic presupposition, which is a neutral one."
notsarc,"And religious folk in the south used the Bible to justify enslavement of thousands or millions of blacks, and also to justify their treating blacks as mere property. I suppose (but am not familiar enough with all of the details to know for sure) that some even used the Bible to justify linching blacks."
notsarc,"Congratulations. You are now part of a minority group. Marriage tends to either work or it doesn't. I know, brilliant observation. What I mean is either the couple is together for decades or spend x amount of years being unhappy until the unhappy is more than the baggage of divorce."
notsarc,"I think that you missed the point of the argument. VT is arguing that the low birth rate in the West is attributable to high abortion rates and the high birth rates amongst Arabs creates a numbers game in favor of the Arabs. Since they respect life (their own, that is) more than the West, their numbers are growing much quicker, while our lack of respect for human life is causing the gap to widen."
notsarc,"Well, we'll ignore the fact that you think dinos are the same as modern day reptiles, and we'll ignore the fact that you are assuming that what goes today must have gone before (something you rant against on a daily basis). Who said anything about reptiles or dinosaurs?"
notsarc,"A fairly good explanation, toned down a bit from Darwin's explanation (for the average person who does not have a PHD in biology)."
notsarc,"Oh, so you were not in any way talking about evolution in these posts? Then why are they posted on the c vs e board?   Please, that's just pathetic."
notsarc,No proof anyone ever went from gay orientation to straight orientation.
notsarc,"First off, define ""government funded"". The FBI? The CIA? Other federal law enforcement agencies? The military? All vital government entities that are and should be armed. The fact that governments around the world have killed their own citizens after disarming them does not mean that they should not be armed, it means that the citizens should not be disarmed. Think of what our country would have become over the last 100 years without an armed government."
notsarc,"how many animals do you think were on the Ark? how many species existed at the time?      the story of the ark does not coincide with contemporary science, but it does work with the rest of Genesis. this is Genesis 2: 15-23"
notsarc,"Actually the majority of homosexuals will tell you it's not a choice. And I, being the wacky gal I am, have a tendency to believe the word of homosexuals on that particular subject over the word of straight neonazicons."
notsarc,"You know 'my kind'? How very presumptuous on your part. Then you know individual choice is the issue, not enforced medical procedures. You didn't answer the question regarding pregnant women who intend to carry to term being required to have a sonogram."
notsarc,"So then the law is flawed because criminals could just as easily get their hands on select firearms, ban or no ban. You've just admitted that the bill did nothing and thus there's no justification for it to be reinstated."
notsarc,"It hasn't happened yet is not absolute proof, just that it makes the probability of it being wrong quite small. By the way, if you are in the least bit intellectually honest, I challenge you to actually act on any of those doubts about the reality of existence and any other reality that we understand from all human experience. Otherwise, if you never act on those doubts, you are simply being hypocritical."
notsarc,"Actually, I find it near impossible to discuss the second amendment without gun control advocates bringing up the third argument. Weak? Yes. Rare? No.      In my opinion, all arguments in favor of gun control are weak."
notsarc,"Yes, you do have a problem with Archaeopteryx. You can't explain it from a creationist point of view. I'm not claiming that it is a ""link,"" whatever that may be. It is a transitional form. It is a small theropod dinosaur that has characteristics that are common to theropod dinosaurs and only theropod dinosaurs and their ancestors. It also has characteristics that exist in birds and only birds. Some characteristics exist in both. The furcula, for example. A furcula has been identified in some theropods, but it is rather rare and then only imprefectly preserved. An indication that it may be mostly connective tissue. Archaeopteryx has a furcula. But even at that it doesn't compare to the same structure in birds. It is intermediate. Imagine that!"
notsarc,actually some did talk about the complexity of life as well as irreducible complexity even though it may not be mentioned in the title
notsarc,So? There are other articles and books that do. Is your link the ultimate authority on the cause of crime?
notsarc,"Far from showing any modern knowledge of blood circulation, this shows:1) if you take the blood out of an animal it will die. A simple fact all civilizations of the time would have known.2) God like for his followers kill living things. He is the God of blood."
notsarc,Neener neener - is it time to go in from the playground yet?
notsarc,No you can prevent the life of the unborn because they are not living but I don't think you should end the life of the born.
notsarc,"That's why I voted as I did as well. Ideally I'd prefer the ""none required"" policy."
notsarc,The burden of a pregnancy is the woman's. It should be left up to her and her doctor to decide what is best for her.
notsarc,"But because your book of mythology tells you about a week of creation, you prefer that (because it requires less thought) to examining reality."
notsarc,You could put the stranger out even if they had nowhere to go and it was freezing cold out.
notsarc,"Notice the double-standard here? The homosexual lobby accuses us of harassment, yet they are willing to provide names and addresses of people who oppose their agenda. I can't wait to see the backlash from this one."
notsarc,"Socialsim and Communism in the Soviet Union failed because the USSR spent its entire existence recovering from war. The country was bombed to hell by Germany twice, around the time of the world wars. The united states put unspeakable amounts of money into their war machine, which forced the Soviets to do the same. I, for one, would buy a gun If I knew my neighbor had six, and he wanted me dead.The CIA and American military carried out immoral operations in 60+ countries since 1945. The soviet KGB, as far as I know, has only been in Germany, korea, China, and Afgahnistan."
notsarc,"If we bankrupt the country, the war on terror won't be the reason. Wasteful domestic spending is the only reason we have trouble funding the war on terror. We need to get intellegent with domestic spending. We could start with the $7 billion EPA."
notsarc,"You do have a problem with this person defending himself or you would not be attacking him. Fear made him do this. The fear was created in him by the buglers.   You want unarmed passengers to attack armed terrorists on airplanes, but you have a problem with a home owner killing buglers."
notsarc,"And just how are the criminals and terroists to be kept from entering a school while armed? Airplanes, probably with some of the new technology, but schools, or bars, or post offices, or government buildings? Just a law that says it is illegal, surely is not going to work. emoticonXDonno"
notsarc,"Yes, do you? It's in a country with no medical facilities, no sterile place to get it done. A country full of HIV and AIDS. I wouldn't be surprised if these mothers had HIV/AIDS and knew they'd leave their child an orphan."
notsarc,"I know of at least 3 personally, including my brother. He fought for custody for years and it nearly bankrupted him. He was trying to get his kids away from an ex-wife that would go away with her boyfriend for weekends at a time and leave their 15 year old daughter in charge of threee younger siblings. "
notsarc,"Yes, but all concepts of right or wrong are subjective."
notsarc,"What I've been saying here, and after awhile - the guilt, depression, etc - will get buried, deeper & deeper - but no negative/damaging experiences leave people. They stay quietly in the background-computer base -until, as you said: Hopefully, the person ""finds some way of forgiving themselves"", right. But what about in the mean-time? - And we know, from research & quite a number of Healers, that rot (inside a person) is damaging... and often in very unsuspecting ways.Much better to life benevolently, in the first place.Annie"
notsarc,"What does adoption have to do with being pro choice or life? I thought that the waiting list was years and years long to get a baby. (Not trying to argue, just don't understand)"
notsarc,Because there are still a lot of people in this country that support oppression and injustice toward gay people.
notsarc,"It is 'change over time', not 'gradual change over time'. The morphological changes tend to happen with a change in the environment. The difference between 'micro' evolution and 'macro' evolution is the number of steps. ""Macro"" evolution is a bunch of 'micro' evoltultions that add up. You have two populations that you can compare that used to interbreed, and for some reason, do not, and then you add on a few 1000 'mircro-evolution' events to each, they become very very different."
notsarc,"Origins of science, whether truly started by those of faith or not, is irrelevant. Whatever science was, it has become a body of knowledge, through application of reason."
notsarc,"Mach, your ability to make the wrong argument on the wrong post continues. I ask a question of this person, you reply not to them, but to me, and with ad hominem, and a 'just-so' statement."
notsarc,"Not really. That's the fallacy of exclusion of the middle. Because there are only two choices, if one is wrong somehow, the other is therefore correct. The problem is that there isn't only two choice for sure. Besides, science is wrong all the time, it doesn't prove that creation is right. In fact, for instance, science estaimtes of moon dust have been proven wildly wrong, and those corrections actually harm creation. "
notsarc,I've always gone the Scylla and Charybdis route before instead.
notsarc,"Exactly. Moreover, in Emerson the discussion of the 2nd Am. is dicta (arguments not pertinent to the verdict) so it is not a binding precedent even for the courts in the same Circuit.A question for the ""original intent"" crowd:What did the Founding Fathers intend with the misplaced comma in the 2nd Amendment?"
notsarc,What this highlights is that the laws of the land are ignored and some people try to place the blame on the victims.
notsarc,"I don't think we have any business forcing anyone to do something they don't want to do. The father is supplying his DNA when he engages in sexual relations. After than point he has in effect signed a blank check. It's like the old saw, if you don't want to do the time, don't do the crime. Fathers to be shouldn't be engaging in sex unless they intend to pony up with the montly check. I come from a bit of a bias on this subject because this was my area of endeavor for some 20+ years."
notsarc,"In some cases yes, in others no. If the mutation gives a huge advantage, then there will be a decline in the size of the gene pool for a while (eg when the Australian rabbit population was reduced form 500 million to 100 million by myxomatosis, the gene pool strunk as a result and the genetic ""mutation"" that gave increased resistance spread throughout the whole population as a result). Most of the time though single mutations do not have such a huge advantage and so genetic variation is maintained."
notsarc,"The counter arguments put forth by its critics do not defeat the Violinist arguments, at the very least. Whether one accepts the argument anyway is another story :P"
notsarc,"I believe you are thinking of orders, not denominations. There is a big difference.   Strict and loony? Could you be a little more specific, because this statement sounds like it's coming out of complete ignorance.   You also seem to be making the assumption that all of the non-Catholic Christians are somehow very similar, which couldn't be further from the truth."
notsarc,"Well, there's also carbon dating... Didn't you post something about a decay curve? Are you now going to deny the accuracy of that?"
notsarc,We don't live on carbon dioxide. We live from the energy stored in carbon compounds when we break them down.
notsarc,"You either did not read my post thoroughly, or are intentional misrepresenting me. Post 250 (which I had actually read before starting this thread) is nothing but DamEtel rambling about homologies between vertebrae embryos. That has absolutely nothing to do with the unexplained homologies that the Denton talks about. Evolution simply cannot, reasonably speaking, account for the homology between your arm and leg, among other examples."
notsarc,No. We know that evolution happens. What would be a problem would be to find the processes that made evolution happen as such incredible rates. There isn't any evidence that it can happen that fast.
notsarc,Because there is no evidence against the virgin birth and there is considerable evidence against Adam -- including the text of Genesis 1.
notsarc,"Little boy, you need to do a little study on Nazis. They specialized in death. Unlike pro-life people."
notsarc,"And yet, for most pro-choice folk on these forums, this question really is meaningless. For, even when it is assumed by these folk that the embryo has rights, they nevertheless argue that abortion is still acceptable. Even you believe this Shooter."
notsarc,"Well then quit trolling, and start debunking the BS by providing links to cases that were solved by having a gun registry in place."
notsarc,"From a book review of BETTER FOR ALL THE WORLD: The Secret History of Forced Sterilization and America's Quest for Racial Purity by Harry Bruinius:http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/26/bo...w/26satel.htmlHmmm, Teddy Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, the Rockefeller foundations, millions of Americans, the State of Indiana. . . all these embraced the concept of EUGENICS.Interesting, yes?"
notsarc,"You contradict yourself. If the earth was then much as it is today, then there isn't enough water on earth to cover it in any fashion. I have done the math. Do you have any idea of how high the Himalayas, the Alps, the Andes, and the Rockies are? Besides, the Bible talks about a flood that lasted a year, not a series of tsunamis."
notsarc,"In older times man had more questions without answers than today. Some men believed if a God of fire because they did not understand what fire was. Because of their misunderstanding they invented an answer, the Fire God. Today we know exactly what fire is and we don't need to invoke some mythical explanation. Today's atheists know that there are many other questions we don't have answers for and it's OK to simply say we don't know instead of buying into the whole ""let's-invent-some-god-to-explain-it"" mentality...."
notsarc,"Come on, people. You don't butcher an innocent baby for the conveience or sins of the parents. There's plenty of people in the world who would have adopted that baby. And if no one else would have, I would have."
notsarc,"Why don't we do the same for straight marriages then?Why doesn't a straight couple that gets married in Colorado, and then moves to Virginia, have to get their divorce ""remotely"" from Virginia.Or maybe you should start thinking about what AUTHORITY Colorado has to grant a divorce to Virginian RESIDENTS."
notsarc,"Actually, the answer might depend more on the nature of the question, or the particular religious cult of the person being asked, etc. In questions of science, fundamentalists will tell you that the answer was revealed to them by their god in their holy scripture.On the other hand, you are characterizing religion as insanity. I think that you really mean that when religion is offered as science, then that is insane."
notsarc,"Well . . . one could make that argument about anything--voting for instance. Amendments are created by voting, and people and legislatures vote (hopefully) their conscience (and the will of their constituents), even if they are religious. I think this is a different matter than, say, displaying religious icons on courtroom walls or grounds, which is a clear endorsement of religion by the government. The 18th amendment was religion-motivated, but it didn't get rescinded for THAT reason. It got rescinded because it didn't work practically. (and because FDR wanted to see the returns on the economy for his New Deal)"
notsarc,"Exactly. It is their fault, but they can do what they choose. It is punishment and you know it, and it is not your job to make sure no ""irresponsible"" pregnant woman goes unpunished."
notsarc,"You do not have a right to drive. No one does. Driving is not a right. The state does not owe it to you to give you a license to drive. The activity of driving is a priveldge granted by the state, not a right.Rights are not regulated by government. You have them and no earthly authority can take it away from you. The state never gave me my rights, I already had them, nor do I have to ask for permission to exercise them."
notsarc,"I believe you, OTHERS pick and choose what you believe. What is sad is how many lose their faith when they find how much they have been mislead."
notsarc,"This stat sounds more than a bit inflated. Seeing as it comes from a website called ""women's issues"" it is probably not all that credible."
notsarc,"And evolution is exhausted. It can't do anything with origins, and recent discoveries of the complexities of the simplest forms of life exhaust it even more."
notsarc,Well he has further political aspirations..........The 9th circuit in Sodom (SF) is always making law instead of interpreting it........That is why they are over ruled so often.......
notsarc,"Well let's see . . . the last time a state started recognizing gay marriages, suddenly there was more support for a Federal Marriage Amendment than ever, Democrats lost more seats in Congress, the minority Democratic leader was defeated after years in office, a protestant presidential candidate carried the Catholic vote against a Catholic candidate, evangelicals in the country were energized, the pro-FMA candidate WON re-election even though his approval rating was 50%, and the state that recognized gay marriage fell under a slew of legal challenges to the point where it's up in the air again.The more you push you agenda through activist judges, the closer you get to the people having to pass an amendment. At least New York was smart enough not to do it right before an election."
notsarc,"It can go both ways. We all doubt. It is what you do with it that matters.[QUOTE=gnojek]If a child grew up never hearing the words religion, gods, spirits, etc. would this child still have faith of some sort?Is faith some innate human tendency?It could be seeing as how there is the ""god spot"" in the brain, but maybe the god spot wouldn't develop as fully in the child that was never exposed to religion or thoughts of the supernatural.QUOTE]Look around. Faith did not spontaneously generate out of thin air. It is obviously part of our psyche. Every civilization throughout history has felt the need for some type of faith. Even on different sides of the planet.It's as natural as the sun rising."
notsarc,"Well, those who keep using that story can't see the real sins of those cities. They are so sure that it was rampent homosexuality which lead to their destruction. Even though we know that before the Angels were ever sent God had spelled out why he was going to destroy them. He sent the angels because they promiced to find even one righteous man. They failed in that because the angels were attacked for being foreigners. Noone who abuses this story is ever going to admit this fact. They can't see past the supposed homosexual issue."
notsarc,"Thats true. However, do we not have a state of reasonable compromise at the moment?"
notsarc,"Yes, I would stay out of it, unless I knew the woman, and she spoke up and asked me for an opinion, or advice. And even in the case of the woman being my best friend, and knowing all the different aspects to the situation, I still would not feel comfortable weighing in. Just like if it was me in the situation, I know that ultimately, it would be my decision, and I would have a right to that decision."
notsarc,"No nation is perfect, Rev. Not even the USA! A singular instance that you quote is not an argument as anyone can just as easily find criticism with the USA over people freed early from jail.You will find black people over-represented in the jails of the UK, the USA and Australia. There is injustice everywhere."
notsarc,"For a 13 year old girl that could greatly damage her body to have a pregnancy so young. She is just starting to grow and mature, and its not healthy, natural, or right to have a pregnancy at that age. She could cause alot of damage being that young."
notsarc,"But pro-lifers often base the pro-life stance on preventing harm. Not just religion. (And in this case they are one-in-the-same anyway.) This isn't a case of harm-preventative-morality versus religious-morality; it's a case of two harm-preventative moralities in conflict, due to each only focusing mostly on one aspect (either the mother or the unborn baby)."
notsarc,"Well if your claim is that you shouldn't push a gun owner's buttons and make them mad, then why are you arguing with me when that's what you're claiming is the wrong thing to do?"
notsarc,"Oh dear, you're back to your nasty ad hominem self. I could have made fun of the fact that you don't know about materialism, and how its a major force behind evolution. Which is itself a suggestion that you are unaware of the socio-political forces driving western evolutionary theory.**The issue is about people behind sciences, making many different 'sciences'; based on bias, cultural/political/historical. 'Peer' doesn't mean anything because 'peers' are just people with the same background/bias etc.I notice you didn't touch upon Nationalist Sciences. Or for that matter, Capitalist Science.*You mean 'understanding' written English.**I say 'western' because there are other evolutionary theories - Marxist, Nazi, Feminist etc.Thank you, come again."
notsarc,"They do offer a good insulating blanket which would keep the body of the reptile warm which in turn, would allow the reptile to remain active for a longer period of time. This means more time to hunt and reproduce carrying the mutation onwards."
notsarc,It is clear that the profetallifers wish to make the pregnant woman a slave to her fetus.
notsarc,"Bad Religion or misapplied Religion has been in every century, country and culture."
notsarc,"The fact that some scientists totally dismiss god is proof of there ignorance of scientific method. There is growing evidence to support the existence of a supreme being, and a lot of scientists are ignorant of this fact, yet they accept theories from the quantum level wich are not proven beyond the proof of the existence of god. Mayabe your mind isnt as closed as others I have spoke with on this subject. I do believe in scientific method, but I also have faith that god is out there."
notsarc,So you're actually claiming that it is a lie to say that the UK has a lower gun crime rate than the US? Even if the police were miscounting crimes it's still a huge and unjustified leap in logic to conclude from that that the UK does not have a lower gun crime rate.
notsarc,"But behind that are deeper, more fundamental issues about what homosexuality IS and the morality of it. To many people who view homoseuxality as immoral, your movement seems to be trying to write immorality into law."
notsarc,"State courts can rule based on state and/or federal law. In this case, the answer was found in the state constitution, so the judge did not need to pursue the issue further.Also, a state constitution can offer more protection that the federal one, as long as, in so doing, it does not contradict the federal constitution."
notsarc,"It is horribly oppressive of women, though, to oppose both abortion and contraceptives. That means that women will have no control over their pregnancies at all."
notsarc,All of these examples are scientifically recognized as human life with a unique genetic code.
notsarc,"As proved above by definition of reason above, it all depends on what premise or starting assumption you have as to what conclusion you will reason out. You are correct that faith does not neccessary require evidence. But there is usually always evidence to support the validity of a particular faith, in this case Christianity."
notsarc,"That is just conservative bias. Conservatives are just as guilty of the same things as liberals and then each has their own ideological idiocy that is unique to each group. Conservatives like classes and don't like change. A pure conservative society would fail just as quickly as a pure liberal one. The last 10 - 20 years as we have become more us vs. them the overall prosperity and well being of the country has declined. With both sides taking the country to extremes. Conservatives eased restrictions and corporations run wild. Those laws are in place for a reason. Liberals overreact and put a choke hold on growth. There was a reason for less restrictive laws, but now they can't do anything meaningful."
notsarc,I don't know if you ever heard of the UK Poll Tax but I could have seen myself protesting by non-payment against such a grotesquely unfair system of taxation had I been of the age to do so.
notsarc,"Again, what evidence? anthropic principle doesn't have anything to do with creation. Puntucated Equlibrium anyone? How is symbiotic relations beteween plants and insects sign of creation?What are you talking about? A dog can't have a cat. That's retarded. What facts are you talking abot? "
notsarc,"Because in the case of glacial/interglacial variation, CO2 functions as a feedback from orbital forcing. Again, this is all very simple, basic stuff outlined in chapter 6 of the AR4."
notsarc,"Because when something passes every experiment thrown at it and when something fits observation better than anything else, then it's as near as damnit fact. We can get pedantic over this if you want, but the conclusion that reaches is that there are no facts."
notsarc,And that is why they are wrong. They don't understand science. Science is not the presentation of proof but explanations of the evidence that have been tested.
notsarc,Either a gross misunderstanding or a gross misrepresentation of evolutionary theory.
notsarc,"so what about jesus' life is credible if the source is unreliable? was it that jesus didnt walk on water but he fed 5000 with 5 loaves? was it that he didnt forgive the samaritan harlot but he raised lazarus from the dead? what did the authors get right? i mean, i can easily believe jesus said he came to bring a sword and not peace. but you dont. so how do we possibly pattern our lives according to how jesus lived if we dont know whether what they recorded was actually what he did?it is necessary to believe that the gospels are true, otherwise you cannot follow a pattrn you dont have."
notsarc,"They have. Prey animals have their eyes to the sides of their heads which allows them to see in every direction, almost 360 degrees around. Predator animals have their both eyes facing forward."
notsarc,Does any part of the theory of evolution give an accounting of how we transitioned from quadruped movements of the ape to biped? 
notsarc,Does the sexual orientation of the would-be single parent even come up?
notsarc,"Yes, but our cells, are functional. It's cells are not yet functional beyond dividing."
notsarc,Honest question Arch: where is the problem with a potential variance of 10 billion years? I know this question may appear ridiculous to you but could you take the question in the spirit it was meant?
notsarc,And I'm going to correct you again. The theory of evolution is by no means an extreme view. It is the prevailing view. More than 99% of biologists accept the theory of evolution as the best explanation for the observations.
notsarc,"Given that I do not hold that opinion, I would challenge you show where I have stated such."
notsarc,I think you have your image of an assault weapon slightly skewed. an assault weapon by its very name is a weapon designed to harm another human. this does not mean full auto it just means that it was never designed to be a target/hunting/self defense weapon.
notsarc,"""Ready to go"", in the sense that living things are equipped with a means of making small errors which are used by natural selection to make new structures.Barbarian, regarding mutations:There is a lot of that. Many mutations are recessive and a population over time accumulates a lot of genetic variation that can become useful if the environment changes. The founder population of lizards, for example, could have had at most, 20 alleles for any gene locus, since each lizard can only have 2. The new ones evolved by mutation. Sometimes, we can even observe that happening, or trace the mutation back to a known ancestor. Would you like to learn about it? ."
notsarc,"Actually ""I don't know"" is quite a valid answer in science.However, again you slip into this false construct of a belief that all that can be known is in the scope of science; which you've also denied saying you believe in the past.[quote=Montalban]Is this a rational statement? If so, prove it rationally, by science. "
notsarc,Oh? And what do you consider yourself when it comes to gun rights? Are you moderate or fanatical? Would you actually declare yourself a fanatic or would you like to be known as a moderate?   I don't think any organization who wants to be taken seriously will declare themselves fanatical about their cause because that would take away from their credibility.
notsarc,"Listen, I have forgotten more than you will ever learn about what is real and true in this world, so either back up your insults with facts or get lost because It is becoming painfully obvious that attempting to reason with you is an exercise in futility. kind of like trying to travel from point A to point B on a merry-go-round."
notsarc,"Well sigma, which is more painful??   Being burnt with salene for 30 minutes to an hour and if that doesnt work after the 3rd time, being born prematurally and laid on a table and starving to death.....   OR   A woman sticking a clothes hanger up and accidentally killing herself but intentionally killing the kid within her?   seems to me that people dont really care about how the baby feels. It has just as much feeling as the mother."
notsarc,"Today's students are tomorrow's scientists. They are unlikely to study something that, if they hear about it at all, they hear about it on a less serious level than they do the happenstance origins of atheist evolution. To reduce ID to other classes like literature or social sciences, etc. (where poetry, fiction, and prehistoric beliefs are the subject matter) is nothing more than a clever, dishonest attempt to belittle it."
notsarc,"Many natural disasters such as tornados, destructive flood, severe drought probably have something to do with global warming.I don't know which is first regarding these combinations. Maybe flood is caused due to global warming, maybe reverse.These phenomena are related each other, so it can't be seperated when we think about it.Maybe global warming itself is not such a big threat but many disadvantages resulting from this are threats to us."
notsarc,And how did the Wise Creator come into existence? All that wisdom and creativity cannot come to existence accidentally or spontaneously...
notsarc,"I think you got it backwards Kelvin. You're the one that said you wouldn't let your children play with toy guns because you're afraid that your children wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a real gun and a toy gun. Blindone never advocated toy gun-control. On the contrary, Blindone was pointing out that toy guns don't harm children.   And if your children can't tell the difference between fantasy and reality how do you expect them to handle a gun responsibly? They might try to shoot the boogey man or their own shadow."
notsarc,"You state ""the woman comes first"". This seems to be your only ""absolute"". Why does the woman come first? Is it because she is fully developed? Is she more important than the child she is carrying?"
notsarc,"How do we know anything for sure? We can't be certain of the Earth's age in billions of years, but we can use carbon dating to figure out it's older then 55,000 years, which refutes creationism."
notsarc,"Actually the kid was on a panel, all pretty much saying the same thing.       Why didn't YOU cite them?"
notsarc,"But my relationship is between a man and woman. You would be asking marriage to be redefined to do that. Remember, part of what defines marriage is that it is between a man and woman."
notsarc,"No Peeling, it would be, ""We proved it was possible to evolve as humans have, so why can only we do it?"" Why hasn't one other creature on Earth ever evolved to our level of sophistication in the same alleged 4 billion years that we have had to attain our level of evolution? If evo is real, then it seems only right that it should touch all species equally and that all species that weren't forced into extinction, but survived and overcame the pressures they faced should have ended up in a similar evolved place that man has attained in 4 billion years.Unless of course that the science of evolution is a humanistic justification to explain our origins but has no basis in fact what so ever. And that is my claim and belief."
notsarc,"And many news stories have referred to the New York shooter as being armed with a ""high powered rifle"" despite the fact that this was blatantly false. Why should we take this story as being fully factual about the details of background checks and gun shows?And a lot of newspapers are repeating the claims that fully-automatic machine guns, anti-tank missiles, fragmentation grenades and rocket launchers, are being bought by mexican drug cartel members -even though they couldn't possibly pass a background check- and that they're being bought from gun stores in America! But no matter how many times we demand proof of such, NONE IS EVER PRESENTED!Come back with undeniable proof that FFL dealers never conduct federally mandated background checks when selling guns at gun shows, otherwise don't post on the topic anymore since you have nothing but lies and scare mongering tactics."
notsarc,"an image is not the original. a photo of you is not you, its an image of you. the image cannot be or replace the original, and isnt intended toregardless of how ""perfect"" the photocopier is, you cannot cash the ""perfect"" copy of the check. it may be a perfect replica, to the detail, but it is still only an image. the problem isnt the quality of the copying process, but the fact that the copy itself is just that, a copy, not the original"
notsarc,The biblical end has got to be near. This was a Doctor who spends all of his life saving people's lives.
notsarc,Well either way he didn't answer the question. I saw the video. I saw and heard his responce. He can't squirm his way out of the fact that he didn't know the answer.    The internet site also quotes:
notsarc,"Besides the hundreds of cases in which such things are directly observed, I guess you're right."
notsarc,"Not once have I said he is perfect. But when people criticize things that I either know are false or I don't agree with, I will back him up. Just like people back up Kerry. I will remember that when you try to defend anyone."
notsarc,No it's not. Perhaps because you don't understand much about evolutionary theory you have confused it with ID. ID is not science and has no evidence to support it.
notsarc,"well i was downplaying your argument because really, pregnancy is not that demeaning to a womans body. ITS NATURAL! OBESITY ISNT!"
notsarc,"The laws of physics are short, descriptive statements that describe the operation of certain natural phenomena that always seem to occur in the same way. Many times the ""laws of physics"" have been amended by further information, causing the law to be restated.Actually, I think he meant the way that we have observed the universe and all of nature to operate."
notsarc,"And as I said, Herbert Spencer's ideas predate Darwin's. Meanwhile, Dawkins writings on religion are irrelevant to whether evolution is good biology."
notsarc,But just try and remove them from those that think we do and you will have a war on your hands. It's too bad we didn't become more like Canada is respect to gun ownership. A lot more people would be alive today and others not sitting in prison for crimes they commited.
notsarc,Is that not agnostic? You leave yourself open to change if evidence dictates it.   Sorry if this is just turning into word games.
notsarc,"Not in the concept of what God is like. Jesus, salvation, the afterlife are other topics. Believing that there is a supreme being is only one step."
notsarc,"The only 'duty' that any human being has with a parasite is to extract it as quickly as they can, if they chose to do so."
notsarc,"But I see two people involved here. Whether the women is better off or not is irrelevant to me. She has no right to kill the other just like you have no right to kill your neighbor. I'm not for allowing decisions on everything and to be against ""choices"" is not a bad thing considering every law restricts choices."
notsarc,"How does being poor limit your responsibility to protect yourself? I know a poor woman who has 10 kids just hoping that one day she would find a man that would be willing to help raise the rest. Also, what do you mean by ""less fortunate? It never happened but she kept having kid after kid and hoping it would. Should she be excused for her behavior because she is poor? No, she kept going to BARS looking for good men. Bad choices = bad outcome. Do you think that this is proof that abortion is necessary? Nope, abortion IS NOT the answer in cases like this, only responsibility can solve the problem. The bad thing is that only one of the men do anything for the children and he doesn't do enough. She has never filed for child support and the kids are almost never disciplined. "
notsarc,"I've been around the creationist/science discussions for a number of years, about 20 or so. The ""you believe in evolution"" argument has been around for at least that long. In my experience it has been a waste of breath to try to convince creationists that I don't believe in evolution any more than they do. As I recall, the argument was even presented in a court case back in the late 60s, or maybe it was the early 80s. I could be wrong. I'll have to check on that."
notsarc,"Oh, is THAT where you are getting your information? The Biotic Message? I read the book tens years ago and eventually sold it because it wasn't worth keeping. You do know that it is a book on biology written not by a biologist, but by an engineer. Right? Walter Jame ReMine is a mere engineer of some sort, and has no degree in biology. And biologists strongly argue against his claims. PS: I even had a few exchanges with ReMine when I was posting at ARN. I argued against him, even though I was an IDist at the time, because he was not being truthful."
notsarc,"For years I've tried to get one of our resident gay members to debate me on that fact. To date, no takers. Want to step up?"
notsarc,"The gene and therefore the enzyme it produces. LPL is the designation for a gene that encodes Lipoprotein Lipase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes lipids in lipoproteins. The actual gene encodes a protein of 475 amino acids that becomes a mature protein of 448 amino acids after cleavage of a signal peptide. One study was able to identify 3 common SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) in the coding region of the gene, 2 of which result in small changes in enzyme function in European populations. The third SNP converts that locus to a stop codon and results in an enzyme that is 447 amino acids long. Thus, the enzyme has been truncated. The resulting enzyme, LPL S447X, is functional. In fact, it results in lower incidence of vascular disease and lower blood pressure. Other truncations result in non-functional enzymes."
notsarc,"How is that a affect of deterrence? Deterrence works by preventing people through the fear of consequences. A dead man has no fears. Furman Vs. Georgia, where the supreme court specifically noted that there is not a single piece of conclusive evidence that the penalty is a effective deterrent."
notsarc,"So God already knows if a particular person will become an addict? That doesn't leave much free choice for that person, does it? If I go to a restaurant and God already knows I'm going to choose the poached salmon for my entree, then I don't have much choice in the matter, do I? Omniscience and free will are mutually exclusive. If God is omniscient, then we are indeed ultimately robots. Deluded with the perception of free will, but robots none the less.Unless of course, God is so omnipotent that he can know everything and still allow free choice. But then reason, logic, and thought become delusional. Sounds like a loose / loose situation to me."
notsarc,"To the extent that working toward social change on any moralistic issue is an 'imposition', sure. But I think one could say that about anything that has a social effect."
notsarc,"This is a very simple, easily answerable question. Most people, especially in America, have problems with people telling them what to do. Teenagers hate being under the authority of adults. Adults hate being under the authority of the government and enforcers of the law. Everyone in the world is under worldly authority, but to actually have a God who created you, which gives him the right to make commandments stating what is good for you and what is not, that makes most people really XXXXXX off. "
notsarc,I've been posting at least a few times a week. That's a lot more than once a month. I pointed out that the US has higher levels of gun crime than most developed nations while you tried to focus on a few tragedies in response to someone questioning the claim that criminals will always get guns. I think it's obvious whose argument is more cherry picked. 
notsarc,"Yes, in my view, it would be morally correct since it has no brain and, in my definition, is not a person with rights. However, if she doesn't want to support the violinist in that future, she has the responsibility to disconnect from (and therefore kill) that brainless body before the brain gets transplanted. Otherwise, if she waits to disconnect until it is too late, she would be guilty of killing the violinist (a person)."
notsarc,"Nothing ""proves"" evolution. However, there's an overwhelming amount of evidence that supports evolution."
notsarc,"Yes, but the statement directly contradicts proponents of ""creation science"" and of ID. Their claim is that they are doing science, even though they can't show how. Scientists have claimed all along that creationists/IDers are doing philosophy and religion, but not science. That is the problem. They never offer any evidence that supports their assertions, only mythology and superstition.But now we have Ray admitting that creationism and ID are not science and can't be included in science. They either philosophy or theology, but not science."
notsarc,"Well, if burglars want to steal guns then it makes sense that they would be likely to target the homes of gun owners. And the source is from the recently published book Evaluating Gun Policy which you can read and review. The source is listed at the bottom."
notsarc,Because that the law one has to presume and of course the law applied to that specific case. As to it being contradictory - well the law is loaded with contradictions if you look at all closely. On the other hand consider that the driver killed the woman AND obviously damaged her fetus beyond recovery - WITHOUT the consent of the woman. In other words the death of the fetus was not by consent of the person who holds the right to decide but rather by the negligence or intent of the guilty party.And yes prior to her death (assumming all other requirements were met) she could have AT HER CHOICE and UN-COERCED have chosen to abort the fetus without incurring a legal penalty. But that would of course be much different.
notsarc,"Unfortunately Democrats have a credibility problem. Many Pro-gun Democrats have been elected, and America is giving them a chance, but apparently they do not believe Obama because of his past Anti-gun support and votes. However   Ms. Feinstein's comments about waiting for the correct timing to bring up gun control  did not help the creditability problem either. I guess only time will tell."
notsarc,"And he accomplished all this human carnage without a gun. This just proves that if it was possible to eliminate all projectile firing weapons from existing on earth, men would find a way to commit atrocities against his own kind just as he did before such weapons existed if murder was in his heart. Guns are not the issue, the corrupted heart/nature of humanity is."
notsarc,"I think I posted that awhile ago. Its huge BS. Thats like saying ""Civil rights hurt blacks"". Even though abortion may have some unwated side affects, its no where near the emotional and physical pain and suffering for the rest of your life than a forced pregnancy. Just goes to show that the pro-life movement is desperate."
notsarc,"Nothing. ""T. Kennedy"" is an alias of a known terrorist."
notsarc,"I know you're talking to Jessica, so I will only comment on this. It would be easier to make it rare if pro-life people weren't intent on making it illegal. Pro-choice people have to make it as available as possible to counter pro-life attempts to shut it down entirely.If pro-life people didn't exist, then the reasonable people could work towards making abortion rare.Take the current debates for example. My entire point is that it should not be illegal. That abortion should be available as a safe and legal choice (it can only be really safe if it's legal). We spend all our time and effort debating the legality that we spend no time on creating programs to help women choose to continue their pregnancies instead of having an abortion, legal or not."
notsarc,If the fetus is human is not relevant? So if everyone says it is human then it still doesn't have a right to live then huh? Do you really support the killing of an innocent life for whatever reason? Do you really think placing one human over another is good (in this case women is more important then baby)?
notsarc,"Wow, I think this is the first time I've ever heard anyone claim that the pro-choice movement is for the sake of the child. Sorry, you aren't even close. I don't know a pro-choicer period that would say it's for anything other than the sake of the woman."
notsarc,"You say you cannot see it from the gay perspective, then you speak from that perspective as a gay man. This is confusing. As a heterosexual, if you are one, would you give up those rights and let gays have the rights?"
notsarc,"Well, their cash cow dried up and even Toby Hoover is going to have to get a new gig. No matter how many times these dire warnings were given they just never came to pass and over 2/3rds of the people are wise to them now and they have lost any credibility at all. Folks all over are now standing up demanding their rights and the left has expended both it's money and political and emotional capital. Stick a fork in them Lucy, they are done emoticonXHoho"
notsarc,"And so on. Yes. a lie generated by creationist liars is what you use as source for what scientists are claimed to adhere to? Your dishonesty is actually rather startling. This is the worst attempt at dishonesty I have seen from lying creationists yet, and your gleeful introduction of that lie shows how truly and completely dishonest you are. Would you stop your lies. You are pathetic."
notsarc,No more so than the Scalia/Uncle Clarence Thomas cabal opining that the words NO LAW mean something other than what they do when they rule in a First Amendment case.
notsarc,"You're obviously an Obama supporter, they're the only people who wouldn't be upset at his abusive tactics of threatening lawsuits against anyone that runs unfavorable ads against him, thus showing that he doesn't support the First Amendment."
notsarc,"So given that there are cases where both dies... we just have to give up the mother's right to live over a fetus (which will die)? What if the mother isn't physically ready to have a baby. In the case of a young female (I'm talking age of 9 and younger, cause there are cases of young kids having their periods) being raped, doesn't she a ""baby"" (and I say baby, because she is still at an age where a parent would consider her their youngin)... have the right to live? For me, if I knew my child was raped and is in no way ready for a child of her own, physically or mentally... I would rather her not risk her life to try and bring that fetus into the world.Abortion should be pro-choice."
notsarc,"I dunno about that, but possibly. They do know that those afflicted with ADD have some unusual structures in their brains too. Last I heard they were investigating the causality of homosexuality with developmental deficencies in the brain. The jury is not out yet"
notsarc,"No it doesn't. That's why Darwin objected to the use of that phrase in reference to his theory. Those who don't bother to learn the theory tend to misunderstand. Fittness is not a reference to big and strong. It makes it too easy to misrepresent evolutionary theory.I'll state it again since you seem to have missed or ignored it the first time. Natural selection is differential reproductive success. Those organisms that are well adapted to their environment tend to survive to reproduce in greater numbers, and therefore they tend to leave more offspring, than those organisms that are less well adapted.You've got to be a pretty shallow thinker to equate an environmental advantage with big and strong."
notsarc,Could you please cite where you are getting this biological definition of evolution?
notsarc,You only say that it won't make a change because you support the effects it will have.
notsarc,"382 - 405 are the dates I have, under Pope Damasus I."
notsarc,"Nice try. If America was an Ally to Germany during WWII, to this day you wouldn't forgive US Citizens no matter what excuse they have."
notsarc,"Well then there's grounds for a lawsuit. Find a group of veterans and get them to sue the VA, funded by the NRA, and take the whole organization to court on charges of violating federal standards."

notsarc,I'm not against concealed carry in principle but open carry seems silly to me. I smell posers.
notsarc,"Then should not your challenge be re-worded to say ""What might be the best...""Because at present we are not at a stage where by we know everything about 'pain' therefore in the current climate, rather than what might be known down the track, I think I have met the majority of your challenge. After-all, you are insisting now on what 'you can measure', and we can't measure all that there is about pain, at present."
notsarc,"I'm not aware that the police used violence in arresting any of the people discussed in this case. Besides, I'm not discussing personal morality here, I'm discussing what should be legal, and what is practical in a society where not everyone shares the same moral views. Government is there to apply limits to what is permitted, based on the will of the people."
notsarc,No its federal property and falls under AR190-11 and other applicable regulations.   If they live off post I believe so if they follow policy and regulations. If they live on post then the POWs must be stored in unit arms rooms and only drawn out with the commander's permission.
notsarc,"Socialism is a very broad category of political ideals, which particular form were you thinking of?And just so you know, Fascism is not a form of socialism in any way. Socialism does not have oppressive governments. The purpose of socialism is to remove the class differences in society, if there is a small group of bureaucrats enforcing their will on the workers then that's a class difference."
notsarc,"I agree, for the most part. Once you get to tanks and helicopters though? Too big, too easy a target for a tyrannical regime. Do you see the Iraqis and Afghanis using tanks and helicopters? I'm sure they could get them if they really wanted, but they're useless against a government that invests in satellite technology and bombers. Better to stick with the rocket launchers and mines."
notsarc,You offer no positive evidence towards Creationism nor did you deny that the idea of Creationism as scientific was destroyed long ago.
notsarc,"so since most abortions weren't rape, do you still support abortions for people who are raped? Just wondering."
notsarc,"None of the 'fishersci' links would take, but I did get a look at the fibre optic systems. Will try again later."
notsarc,"Also another example put forward is a bacteria that can only sustain itself by eating Nylon. The theory goes - nylon is a recent invention therefore this bacteria must have eolved recently.What it suggests however is that a portion of an existing population would have died if not for nylon... the bug has to have nylon, or it will die.It is akin to looking at a portion of the human population who would die from heart-trouble. But thankfully we've now got artificial hearts, therefore this portion can survive. They are not a new species of human, but live only because of a recent invention."
notsarc,"He was barred for presenting hard evidence against the Big Bang. Observable evidence. He was the head astronomer at Mt Carmel not just another astronomer. He was our best one.Being barred from the telescopes he was in charge of , being fired , and having to move to Germany is not what you consider suppression? I am not willing to discuss this with you anymore if you refuse to do it honestly. You can say anything."
notsarc,Well do you mean Texas or Texans? Because Texas holds the record for execusions in the US. Not something I'd be proud of.
notsarc,"That wasn't my question. My question wasn't what you said, but what you believed. You sort of answered that. But the same people spouting off about the second ammendment being the reason for guns should also be for it defending your right to a nuclear bomb."
notsarc,I have never disagreed that marriage is a special dependent class. My point is that it is a society-sanctioned special class.
notsarc,"I don't think people have a right to kills themselves (obviously not natural and obviously not legal right now). As for the other question, I wouldn't think a blatent disregard for the others health is morally ok."
notsarc,"I do not understand why people are stuck in this mindset that we have to define ALL abortions as either right or wrong. In between, there is the option of calling abortion under certain circumstances as right or wrong or calling abortion in certain trimesters as right or wrong. Why limit yourself to the extreme views? I do not believe that the original post asked for an absolute answer, just a survey of opinions. After all, as you say, abortion is not math and there is no one answer that everyone might agree with. However, the question of people's opinions on the beginning of personhood and how it relates to the morality of abortion lies at the very core of the debate on abortion rights. Really ... what other question is more relevant?"
notsarc,"Oh, we don't have to - sorry, I wasn't clear enough there. What I'm trying to do is correct your misapprehensions concerning common descent. You said this:"
notsarc,"The 7 day creation I am referring to, not merely the possibility of divine creation through the Big bang etc"
notsarc,"Well, as usual the Creationist is trying to make an arguement against science using their moral viewpoint. Forget about all that pseudo science trying to discredit evolution and geochronology, all it comes down to is this: ""My religion has the exact answers to questions about my origins, I do not like what science has to say on this subject"".Its so much more succinct that way, I just wish they could be up front about it."
notsarc,No. I never mentioned grades. You brought that one up. I'm saying that having guns on school campus isn't a good plan due to the high level of emotions in the area.
notsarc,"Yes Peeling; you say this with such assurance, yet what you can't explain with any assurance is why only one offshoot of the Primate genus evolved into what human beings are today. Why only us, when we all allegedly started in the same environment with the same ecosystems putting the same pressures on us. What I'm saying is that in every place where our alleged primate ancestors fossils have been found, so haven't the fossils of animals described as lower primates been found. So your explanation that one species evolved while another stagnated or died out rings hollow with me. Especially since you can actually prove absolutely none of this. Can't you see that Peeling? None of this is provable."
notsarc,Yea I agree with you on how there was no exact se t of laws at the beginning of creation. The reason I say that they most likely didn't marry their sisters is mostly cause God gets mad at Cain and places a mark on his head so everyone he runs across will not kill him unless they want to die a death 10 times worse than his. Kinda just says that there are other people out there.
notsarc,"That is an erroneous line of reasoning because it fails to take into account the myriad of other options open to a women after birth to remove the newborn from her care without any ill effects (physically anyway). Killing in the instance of a newborn is not justified because of those other options open to her. By contrast, a pregnant woman has exactly one option open to her to remove the fetus from her care and that is abortion. I would contend that the same line of reasoning that allows for adoption can be used here, that no one must donate their resources to a dependant.Your reasoning that a woman, using the same line of reasoning that pro-choice people employ, can withhold her bodily resources ""until the newborn dies"" as if that is equal to withholding bodily resources in pregnancy is faulty."
notsarc,But that doesn't help much with calculating the length of a day from actual astronomical observations. Perhaps if we told Freeofthought that the current rate of slowing of the earth is 0.005 sec/year/year. I have no doubt that Freeofthought will misunderstand that number - it is a rate. Just assume that rate has been unchanging even though it hasn't been.A lot of the creationists misunderstanding comes from remarks like the following.
notsarc,You blame others for your failure to understand the basics.
notsarc,Any form of legislation is a voting matter. That's the way our system works.
notsarc,"Lurch, I don't appreciate your condescending tone. If you want to challenge my assertion that you are a pompous XXX that jumps to conclusions, you will need to be a little less judgemental and start thinking outside of Darwin's Black Box."
notsarc,"Well, in the sense that we cannot actually detect the intelligent design Behe proposes, then it it OUTSIDE the limit of actual detection."
notsarc,"Right on! A real man supports those he loves, through thick and thin. He doesn't try and control the things he can't either.In the end, it's not a man's decision. It is not his body, therefore, he has no right to make the ultimate decision. He can only express his view. That's about it. (I'm pretty sure it's not any easier for her to decide). So cudos to those men."
notsarc,"So what, the thread isn't about her signature. If we started responding to threads by attacking people's signatures, we'd all be in serious trouble. Especially me emoticonXAngel"
notsarc,"You JUST said they get health care in the hospital! Read your post, where's there NO healthcare. And it IS based on the ability to pay...you just want me to pay for someone else's and in the most inefficient way possible."
notsarc,They need to keep their opinions to themselves and out of the law the effect gay peoples lives. I see nothing wrong with locking up those who incite hatred towards gay people just as we lock up people who shout fire in a crowded theatre.
notsarc,I will stop quoting here. Don't want people to have too big a read. Actually ToE isn't all that random. To a certain degree yes. But Sexual Selection aka a part of the ToE. Dictates that when there is a benificial/attractive change. That change will be enhanced almost exponentially. Because the female of the species will be programmed to search for that and will carry the gene herself so will give it to her off spring. And the male will be more succesfull so produce more off spring. So no instant eyes or anything like that. I think that's what you were implying. Sorry for responding in Kronus's stead. I'm sure he can defend himself but I found it unjust the way you replied to his post and attacked it on foundations that you didn't have.
notsarc,Even though I am for gay marriage I do agree. Correlation is not causation.
notsarc,"I think it would be an exception as well.But if you see an indicator that might point to an ""exception"", I think the question should be asked.Consider the flip side of things. The question doesn't get asked.If Skip had been the type of man to let a gay couple's house burn to spite gays, don't you think that the gay couple would have had grounds to sue the city in such a situation?Part of this is just the city covering its own XXX. If they ask the question, and the guy lies, they have helped to cover their own XXX by asking the question."
notsarc,"Holy grail implies it is like a religion, which it is not. If evidence is found that overturns this theory, it will be discarded in favour of a better one."
notsarc,"wow... you are bent on harping on creationists arguments at whatever the cost.first of all, you are not even considering that the majority of people are misinformed of what evolution is not because they have creationist motives, but because they go to the dictionary for definitions"
notsarc,"Incorrect.   Evolution is not something that must be adhered to. It is a scientific theory. As such, if evidence was brought to light that evolutionary theory couldn't account for, then the theory would be altered or scrapped. It's really quite simple."
notsarc,"Yes, you are missing something. How come age doesn't start at conception? How come when babies are born they aren't 9 months old instead of, well, seconds old."
notsarc,As a gun owner I'm also a property owner. Or are you denying that guns are property?
notsarc,"Logically incorrect. One can as many red balls as one likes, and still only have one green one."
notsarc,Apples and oranges. We're not demanding that they have abortions either.
notsarc,"But let me guess ... if they step down RIGHT after they find they will have to issue to gay couples, you'd be in favor of them being able to be sued for it, simply because the ""discrimination"" in such an event was toward gays? Right? At least if you are consistent with your stance elsewhere in regards to 'timing' ... emoticonXRolleyesAnyway, aside from that inconsistency with your position elsewhere, I agree that county officials should need to comply. After all, there are probably OTHER examples whereby county officials have to do things that they are religiously against, such as issue divorce papers. Or marry some drunk couple that they know aren't really being serious even though they're tying the knot ... If all county officials could just refuse to do their job because of their objections--for WHATEVER reasons--it would be a collosal mess."
notsarc,"Gun control maintains its racist roots even in this day and age. What other reason would there be for Form 4473 to ask applicants what their race is? What is the importance of knowing if somebody's white, black or mexican when they're buying a gun?"
notsarc,"Actually the Alan Guttmacher Institute is quite reputible. They have their own web site. Check it out. Also, why would a site called ""womens issuses"" be in valid?"
notsarc,"would that be legaly owned guns, or criminals who have guns (and also ues guns) for there crimes? most Gang members have guns, if they are killed in a drive by shooting, is the gun responsable, or would it be the illegal activitys?"
notsarc,"To you, it may be an incorrect statement. But if it is, you have to tell me what it is you kill and take the life away from when you abort the zygote. Not knowing if it is being killed or not knowing someone wants to kill it makes no difference. Injustice is still practiced there, and not even some abortion doctors realize it."
notsarc,Oh joy another drive by with absolutely no proof or evidence.
notsarc,"Everyone expects that. What they don't and shouldn't have to expect is that they will be specifically targeted and have to pay more, be penalised more, etc. than hetero couples such as yourself or me and my husband."
notsarc,"""Babies"" are a stage reached after birth. If you are talking about abortions, then no babies are involved, anti-choice, histrionic revisionist linguistics none withstanding"
notsarc,"None of these alternate views go outside the framework of evolution. They all use poor wording, though, and try to lead one to some conclusion about ""information"" or something."
notsarc,"You know what they mean, I know what they mean, but as someone involved in teaching evolution to high school kids I wish they'd avoid the implication of purposeful change and just refer to beak size changing in response to new selective pressure.As I said, I may just be being nit-picky. Language apart, this is another nice example of evolutionary change happening right before our eyes."
notsarc,"They are safer. The 300 gun deaths per year rate has dropped since then.Let's have a little reality intrude on the gun porn fantasies. Only 13% of Swiss homes ever had an Army-issue weapon in them, Militia service extending only from age 20 to age 30, and the ammunition was stored in a sealed pack, with severe punishments for the seal being broken."
notsarc,"Heller is about determining the answer to a long standing question on the nature of the Second Amendment, and how much gun control is legally allowed. Roe v. Wade is about finding legal precedent for the murder of unborn children.I see absolutely no comparison between the two."
notsarc,"Many of the gun hating crowd also own guns. It's the elitism belief, that they're superior to all humans and thus deserve to be armed, while everyone else in the world should be unarmed and bow before them as if they're gods."
notsarc,But I think that is the point. What if you didn't agree with the germ theory of disease? Does that mean that it shouldn't be taught in health classes in our schools? Should it be replaced by the bad humors of night air theory? But not everyone agrees with that theory either.
notsarc,"if the only choices we can possibly make are the one God approves, then we dont have free will, because we cannot free choose the option that God does not approve of, which means we are forced to only choose the options that God approves of. this is not free will"
notsarc,"We cannot prove the existence of God for, by definition, he dwells in a reality outside our own. Similarly, I cannot prove the existence of a Flying Shoe in Hyperspace, nor can I disprove it, but I can prove that the Flying Shoe does not exist in our world because it exists, by definition, in Hyperspace.I can make up anything I want and say it exists in another universe. A round square, a colorless green idea that sleeps furiously, you name it."
notsarc,"Well, it might help if you could propose a mechanism for such changing traits that would stand up as well as the current model of genetic inheritance."
notsarc,I think more than this is the principle of human dignity. That humans have inherent dignity and value at every stage of life. This is transcendent of whether they are conscious or unconscious and it is why we treat 24 week premies who have no real conscious existence and a 30 year old automobile accident victim in a coma on a respirator and you and me the same. So strongly do humans recognize this inherent dignity that even in death a person is dignified with a funeral ceremony recognizing their life had inherent meaning and value. We build memorials to those who were victimized in life.
notsarc,"To say nothing of the possible threats to people's safety, if not actual acts of violence."
notsarc,"So have I, since I know that evolution has and does take place. But I catch it from both sides because I don't believe the scientific explanation of the origins of life or the beginning of intelligent awareness."
notsarc,"Those abortions that are perpetrated as ""birth control"" should be outlawed."
notsarc,Dealing with a designated nuisance species isn't the same thing as hunting. It's wildlife management.
notsarc,"So, I guess you didn't get the memo that this country was FOUNDED on Christian/Judaic beliefs. Remember: You do have rights; to an extent."
notsarc,It may only be salvaging to you but to the parents involved it is body theft.Let me just ask you to step in our shoes for just 10 minutes imagine trawling around 100's of hospital labs and medical schools seeing all these poor little babies lined up in jars and i don't mean just a few there is up to 50 in each hospital and school imagine looking at those jars hoping that one of them is your child so you can at lastgive him the burial he/she deserves(a basic human right) yet at the same time praying that none of them are yours.Having done that can you still say that it is only salvage bearing in mind our children were only sent for post mortem and many of us have not seen them since?
notsarc,"End the guessing right now. Don't guess. The meaning of the 2nd Amendment is explained in two documents: 1) The Militia Act of 1792 and 2) Federalist Papers #29. Both of which was written by the same Congress and same men who wrote the 2nd Amendment, the Constitution, and established the political philosophy of our country.First the Militia Act states WE AREA ALL IN THE MILITIA and that all citizens bring thier own weapons. - http://www.constitution.org/mil/mil_act_1792.htmThe more broader philosophy and intent of the 2nd Amendment and the Militia Act is further explained in the Federalist #29. - http://federalistpapers.com/federalist29.htmlThese documents are the thoughts and intent of the men who wrote the 2nd Amendment. So gun control slime are guessing or trying to reinvent history when they think gun ownership is collective. None of these documents anywhere support the collective idea."
notsarc,"You asked where the line should be drawn in regards to weapons?How about where ownership and use of weapons does not violate the rights of others. Before you respons think about it. Do anything you want. If I don't violate anyone then what is the beef? If I don't break any laws or endanger anyone what is the beef?The safe storage and handling of cannon, cannon propellant, and cannon ammo is well known. They can be stored in places typical of homes without violating the rights of others. BTW a cannon is not a weapon. It is considered a 'firework' by the ATF. Ever see a civil war renactment? Lots of cannons? So yes having a cannon in your front yard does fly."
notsarc,"Semantics. God has mandated against homosexuality. My point is, people are prepared to admit that the creation story, and the story of noahs arc are metaphors. They read them, and then look at the evidence to hand and say ""Well, it can't be really true the way it is written, so it must mean this...""But the bias of the church against homosexuality is based of a small passage of text which, it seems, cannot be interpreted away. That part that condemns homosexuality is accurate, straight-from-gods-mouth truth. Again, why the dichotomy? Why are some parts of the bible open to interpretation, but others are rigid?"
notsarc,Actually they do. Whether or not you think they should is another matter entirely. Did you not notice where the article came from? From a paper in India. I also found articles on the same subject from papers all over the country as well as in other countries such as Romania.   Save your snobbery for someone else.
notsarc,"Just some interesting information I learned when we went caving a couple years ago (a real cave, not one of the commercialized ones). Bats actually have better eyesite than humans, but even they can't see in pitch black. No eye can."
notsarc,I think that the type of weapon does make a difference. A tyrant would be more dangerous to the world if he was armed with WMDs rather than knives.
notsarc,Kronus said this was a win for science. He never mentioned that religion was discredited- never mentioned religion at all. Religion and science are utterly unrelated. Why would you make that connection?
notsarc,"Then 99% of creationists are not informed as far as I can tell. It seems that your position is that ""informed"" creationists are neo-Darwinists, fully accepting of the theories of evolution."
notsarc,"No, they're the same species. If you put all these fish in the same pool at the end they would all breed with each other. The example wasn't of speciation, merely of a change in a population driven by the environment, which is the essense of evolution."
notsarc,"But if you actually take time to read the study that is posted on that website it appears that the claims of the NSPOF are doubtful, inconsistent with other studies, and likely biased in favor of people answering that they had used a gun to defend themselves. "
notsarc,"Actually in high school I had a friend who used to be in placement. He was sixteen years old an he said he got the s*** beat out of him by an eight year old boy. ""Street kids"" get their XXX beat every day, pain is nothing new to them. It seems they're immune to it. It doesn't matter how hard you can hit, if you can't take a punch, then you can't call yourself street-worthy."
notsarc,"I don;t really know anything about british gun control in colonial india, and don't really see it's relevance, since colonial india is gone. I DO know that this had nothing to do with the British refusal to conscript indians into the British Army. This was directed at the disarming of the Indian Army under british rule. The indian citizens were never actually disarmed under British rule, just the army. During WWI, indians were allowed to volunteer for the British army (the British knew it was a bad idea to conscript men from colonies)."
notsarc,Crime has dropped significantly in New York and Los Angeles in recent years. 
notsarc,I'm glad you made the same correlation I did. ToE is a substitute for #### in this case.
notsarc,"Actually, everything the bible say's belies your ""atheist answer"". The reality is that the world itself and all of Gods Creation speaks to His existence as being self evident. It takes a degree of faith to accept Jesus as our personal Savior, but as far as accepting the reality of God Himself, all one need do is look observe the world we live in to see that only an incredible and loving God could create such a Beautiful and marvelous World with so many amazing symbiotic and perfectly interdependent forms of life."
notsarc,"So sorry, Anastasia...that's a horrible thing to face. And now, using that excuse? What!   If justice was swift for the guilty then he would not have escaped only to do it again. Some criminals never change, and via your testimony, only live to do it again.   There are some who need to be put to death.   Your situation made me shudder, Anastasia. But, I am glad you didn't let it (revenge) effect you to the point of taking his life yourself.   If it would have been my father, those many years ago, I cannot say that I would have waited, nor would have accepted that lame excuse of retardation. I could very well be in prison myself."
notsarc,And where exactly did you hear this? I find it hard to believe a governent that couldn't keep an affair or a low-level break-in under wraps could keep something like that secret................. Also if it is true and among alliance forces why do you blame solely the US?
notsarc,"Except several rligious organizations around the country have financed, and gathered signatures to put anti gay marriage amendments on the ballot. They have a religious belief that marriage is between one man and one woman. They have turned this belief into law regaurdless of the religious beliefs of gay people. Any one who has voted yes to place these amendments into state constitutions because they have a religious belief that excludes gay people from marriage has also imposed those religious beliefs upon gay people. In short I have been barred from marrying the person I love because someone else, that I do not know and who does not know me, has some sick religious belief."
notsarc,"So we should just say ""god did it"", and give up?"
notsarc,"NOt true,California's ammendments are not doing as well as other states did. You are talking about a very liberal state. If it is decided that marriage is allowed by the courts, then you are talking about taking away rights people have been granted by the courts. I just don't think that will happen in Calf. much too liberal."
notsarc,"What you are talking about here is the *potential* to exist being important. I would personally also thinking that potential existence is important, but not nearly as important as an existing person. After all, unfertilized eggs and sperm also have the *potential* to become full people but no one is concerned about their loss. For many of us it is the actual mentally-existing person that is most important. For both the 'braniac"" case you present and for the early term fetus, if there is no reason to kill it, then don't. However, if there is a contest between the rights of a living, existing person and the rights of either *potential* person, then I think the rights of the living person win out."
notsarc,Because....expansion occurs after heat is added. How can a expansion occur with a prior cause? You're saying the reaction and cause happen at the same time. Show me an example that does that.
notsarc,"That's because its sophistry. Its an inherent contradiction and it simply means we don't have the capacity to understand it. Another more common example is that the assertion that the universe cannot be endless, and yet as far as we know it is. Trying to understand it is for us humans like an ant trying to fathom the theory of relativity.Damn are we ever conceited as a race...we seem to think that if we can't understand something, it cannot be. We also tend to think, in every generation, that we have achieved somehow the pinnacle of progress."
notsarc,"So what standards of proof do you hold the bible to? What allows you to hold it next to other religious or fantastical texts and say ""Yes, this one is definately, without fail, the word of God, and this one is not."""
notsarc,So do you want to argue my points or do you want to argue me? Which of my bullits are wrong? Which of them are right?
notsarc,"Accidents for one. Just last week a man who was drinking and cleaning his firearm accidentally shot and killed his daughter. Run a google search for ""man shoots self"" the amount of accidental shootings is rather disturbing yet funny. Most of these however are due to improper gun safety though."
notsarc,"Yes I disagree with that point. The navy, just like the police, can't possibly be everywhere that danger might raise its ugly head. Merchant ships can't afford a 24/7 navy escort anymore than the average citizen can afford to hire body guards 24/7.There's no legitimate reason why merchant ships should be unarmed and unable to address dangers that deliberately come after them."
notsarc,"Any belief system is a religion loosely defined. I'd like to know how you think rights are afforded to born persons if not by a belief system or at the very least a belief in natural rights. Either way, that doesn't address the point I had. If I can't impose my beliefs on you then who you are to impose your belief of me not hurting chemist99a?"
notsarc,"Obviously not. If the right to life trumps all other rights, then it follows that the mother's right to life and the child's right to life cancel each other out.       Mind you, if it's her choice then the pro-life movement endorses such heroism, right?"
notsarc,"And were THIS the 17th century, I might understand that, but this is the 21st century. We don't ""bleed"" people to make them well; we don't have barbers performing surgery and we usually have a trained physician in the delivery room."
notsarc,It's still not right for religious people to have to never speak their beliefs. It's a form of tyranny.
notsarc,"So, in summary, you aren't against the death penalty on principle. You just want it used judiciously? Same here. Where we'll differ is in the details of what's judiciously."
notsarc,You can't...only admin can...and there's no need to be sorry.
notsarc,Well we assume a right to your own body here. It is also important for you to justify why there should be a difference in human and person and then justify why doing so this time is different from when this was previously done in history.I guess I don't agree with the idea that you have no rights until you can prove you should have them...if this is the standard then we are all in trouble.

Many believed in alchemy (they were wrong), harmful effects of night air (they were wrong), spontaneous growth of maggots from rotting meat (they were wrong), rats arising from grain (they were wrong), and the Bible (they were wrong). If it is important that Newton believed in the Bible, why isn't it as important that he believed in alchemy and did not believe in the divinity of Christ.There isn't any such thing as science from a Christian perspective.

I think they are generally pretty good public schools, it's just the state school board that keeps effing everything up when they get some christonazis on board."
notsarc,"besides pain, there is a plethora of experiences that take place in a person's mind that cannot be yet detected by science. imagination, taste, dreams, art appreciation, etc. even though these things are real, they cannot be quantitatively described in physical terms, so they cannot be treated by science"
notsarc,"No no; again, you don't get it. He's only struggling because of people like you who deny the obvious. Rather than listen to what Majerus says about Majerus's project, you're listening to Mr. Mistaken Coyne and the author of the the Science article, which doesn't say what you think it says."
notsarc,"Well, to say it has no mental existence doesn't really tell the whole story. The fetus WILL have (more than likely) full mental existence in a very short time. It seems to me that if you ""view humanity with mental existance as important"" you'd also view as important that the unborn baby WILL indeed reach that point, in all likelihood. "
notsarc,"So, because they don't interpret the bible as you do, they believe that there are no deities? That is what you said..."
notsarc,"Again???? Gun control laws by design are meant to kept inner city citizens (i.e. black) from owning guns... Liberal terms such as ""saturday night special"" all have racist undertones. Also since the majority of gun violence in the US is minority on minority... Who are these laws meant to target?"
notsarc,It also allows SCOTUS to strike down State laws that violate constitutional rights ;)
notsarc,It's truly amazing that even someone like KH can disprove evolution so quickly.
notsarc,"If Obama had his way, standing against the government would be the most patriotic thing someone could do."
notsarc,"That's a bit of a sidestep. Abortion is not genocide because abortion is not destruction of a certain group of people based on race, religion, ethnicity, etc. There is no way to make a case for abortion being genocide without making capitol punishment qualify as genocide. Frankly, I think it's easier to do the latter (yet most pro-lifers are also pro-death penalty).If you want to make an argument, then make an argument. But don't call abortion genocide; that's just dumb."
notsarc,"Really, fetal persons are born. Science has demostrated that birth really occurs into the womb, not when one leaves it."
notsarc,"Theropods had hollow bones like birds. It was ""developed to be lighter[sic]."""
notsarc,"Actually, it hasn't. Phylogenetic analysis has no relevance to Occam's Razor. Further, DNA for all organisms is the same until you examine specific sequences. It isn't that the DNA is different, what matters is the the sequence of the bases is different."
notsarc,"And what is the full quote? Was it talking about, lets say for example, tutles, where over 90 percent of them die before reaching adulthood?In many species, that is true. The 'rule of thumb' is that the more individuals do not reach adulthood, the more offspring that species has."
notsarc,"If that is a human being, then is my kidney a human being too?"
notsarc,"So ban guns? That is like curing the headache by cutting off the head. Why not make it a crime to sell a gun privately. Perhaps make it a legal requirement to go to a licensed firearms dealer who at no charge to the parties other than the cost of the background check run the potential buyer through the database. I would certainly be willing to do this. As a responsible gun owner, I would hate to think that the firearm I was going to sell to someone might be going to a felon, or someone likely to use it to commit a crime. "
notsarc,"Just because we interpret the available evidence differently, for you to assume from that, that we believers know nothing about the universe we inhabit is arrogance to the max."
notsarc,"No. I will never allow ""the people of the country"" to tell me what is best for my my life or my health.To quote Jane Austen in Pride and Prejudice.""I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to you, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me."""
notsarc,"we do......most fossils found are surface finds -- which means anything found on the ground probably contradicts uniformitarian principles because every fossil found laying on the ground probably -- according to ToE -- did not die at the same time. For example, many mammal bones are found on the surface -- yet so are dinosaur and other ""ancient"" bones from animals that supposedly lived millions of years beforehand. Of course evolutionists will come back and claim ""erosion"" with no evidence of such, not to mention how rock can be removed from bone after millions of years of being cemented to it.I've got a 900-page book called ""Hidden Archeology"" (Cremo) that dives into hundreds of fossils and artifacts that are in the ""wrong"" strata. Your assertion is blatantly false."
notsarc,"I can see what you are saying. It's pretty much true...being a Jewish homosexual, I know it first hand. But just for once, couldn't they pick on somebody else?It seems almost like a bully tactic for the Christian heterosexuals who are against same sex marriages to pick on someone who doesn't have a legal leg to stand on...that's sad."
notsarc,"Nonsense. The most widely accepted idea is that these epics were oral traditions that were finally recorded in writing, possibly by a guy named Homer. Read and read."
notsarc,"Nearly all the food humans eat today, even in the Western world is GM including maize, tomatoes, and soy, etc, etc. used as ingredients in products such some soymilk. Essentially everything is with the exception of ""organic"". However, as i noted above, I wouldn't make this argument because I think GM soy esecially is not very healthy for people snd GM foods tend to be more prone to bacterial infection which can make people sick. I haven't read from all sides, however."
notsarc,"I disagree. I've been in a loving, committed relationship for 25 years to the same person exclusively...how does this have a negative affect on you?"
notsarc,"And last years stats say, 3rd July 2009   The most violent country in Europe: Britain is also worse than South Africa and U.S."
notsarc,So there you have it: AMENDMENTS ARE PART OF THE CONSTITUTION.
notsarc,"Thanks, Clive, you're a good sport. Of course I can't agree with the idiot part. Rash, unwise, unknowledgeable, maybe, but not fools."
notsarc,"It's a flawed step in the right direction. I support it compared to nothing. I did not support it when they were considering CUs vs. full marriage. They took the politically expedient way out.Lest you leap to any unwarranted conclusions, my main objection is the blatent inequality inhererent in CUs."
notsarc,The difference of 43 deaths a year is the 4th largest flucuation since 1990 - not what you call insignificant. Would this difference be made if more guns did equal more crime?
notsarc,"Well... someone hasn't been following the campaigns for the so-called ""protection of marriage"" amendments, federal or state."
notsarc,I think you are on to something.The problem I see is that any proponent of a plan such as this will have toi take on both the health insurance lobby and the pharma lobby and their bottomless well of $$$ and propaganda.Here's hoping now that there's a new sheriff in town.
notsarc,"Well, in the case above, it was step-by-step. First, an existing enzyme was modified to a new use, and over time, became refined to work better and better. This is the way evolution works. Nothing is de novo; it's always a modfication of something else. Second, a mutation produced a regulator that only allowed the enzyme to be produced if the substrate was available. Again, this was refined by natural selection over time. In the end, the newly-evolved system was irreducibly complex, because all three parts have to be present for the system to work. And do show us your numbers proving that such processes can't produce new information. If you don't know how, I'd be pleased to show you how a mutation changes the information in a population."
notsarc,"So would you care if abortion were outlawed. If so, what would be bad about allowing a view that places objective value in human life to be the basis for making law?"
notsarc,"I didn't answer or you didn't understand? Actually I did answer. The knee joint I described is from a bipedal hominid - there is no question about it. The skull, even though I gave it very ape-like features, is from a biped. There are many examples of what I described."
notsarc,That would be more likely than finding evidence for abiogenesis.
notsarc,Oh really ? Parts of New Orleans were under water for more than 40 days before all the water receeded. Hasn't the plant life there replenished naturally in the wild ? Of course it has. The Earth is very able to repair itself in spite of modern mans sense of self importance. Here's some interesting photographic evidence of it. www.pbase.com/andrys/noah
notsarc,"Or that they tend to be better prepared, or even less willing to accept help from others or get breakdown cover. That's the trouble with these kind of stats, the interpretations are pretty open to debate."
notsarc,I didn't vote for a republican or a democrat in 2008 and in 2010 it doesn't matter because my rep is not challenged.
notsarc,"So do I, but my reasoning is highly speculative, even by my own standards."
notsarc,"Because the men who wrote it mixed their mythology in with their heros. The first 11 chapters of Genesis are obviously mythology. And if what you say is true, then I guess that means that the Illiad is historical. Why would Homer be right about some lives and events, but wrong about others? And of course, there are other parts of the Bible that are pure fiction - Jonah and Job for example."
notsarc,the fetus would be a real person...and it seems like....in order to make the iraq war/abortion connection....you would have to support the war!
notsarc,Well if they're automatic weapons then they're obviously importing them illegally from outside the country and violating federal regulations. You've got even bigger problems than you think.
notsarc,"Well this is what i am saying. The probability of a and b in one organism i very low. And the probability of A and B in many generations is lower than just A. This is what Behe deals with in his book. One reason evolution of primates interest me more than bacteria is the the number of organisms and generations is much much lower, and the changes involved must be pretty big. It involves Real evolution as opposed to stuff like antibiotic resistance or sicke cell haemoglobin that i see more as a reversable adaption, not a developement to a permanently better/more complex state.   IMO there should be possible to make some sort of calculation regarding the probability of RM being cause of the changes."
notsarc,"Actually, Mega didn't make any claims. He just reposted an editorial."
notsarc,Really? Do all your views depend on somebody else changing them for you?
notsarc,I think our culture is going to play a big role in this as well. I think that is where the majority of this problem lies.
notsarc,But your new language would be meaningless. The definition of a circle or a square does not vary from language to language. Mathematical definitions are not matters of opinion but quite precise descriptions so that all mathematicians will understand what is meant when the term is used. The words may change but the meaning doesn't. Math is not opinion. It is not my opinion that a triangle has three angles. That is a matter of definition.Apparently Habbit doesn't understand that substituting the words of another language does not change the concept. That sort of argument is basically ignorant XXXX.
notsarc,"Well, I've personally measured the gravitational pull of a ball of lead about 5cm in diameter. Are you suggesting that angels push the planets around? That was the leading theory before Newton."
notsarc,That's why the Second Amendment protects the private ownership of arms like the .50 BMG and other such powerful weapons.
notsarc,"This is not my problem. As I explained above, I just have to show inconsistency in order to reject the validity of all the claims in the Bible as being undeniable truth. And with the Bible, that's damn easy to do."
notsarc,"Well said.   With this religion, the gap is very wide between the ""average guy"" and ""authority"", because their clergy is more involved in politics than the clergy of Christianity, or the Creator himself. It fits with more Democrats being evolutionists, and more Democrats favoring bigger domestic government."
notsarc,"I would suggest you look at the faero island mouse then. That is a new species, and it is not man doing it, but rather nature itself."
notsarc,"Ah, you've engaged in the grammarian nitpick function of debate. Sad, but predictable.       Obviously, I was discussing the entire article, which is making that argument. It is generally bad form to quote an entire post when it reaches such length."
notsarc,"Guess what, I'm pro-life as well, that is why I'm also pro-choice."
notsarc,Hope you have fun carrying your pistol through the post office lobby!
notsarc,"Ok...many many people have been killed in Africa because of the policies of the countries in the EU, South America, Asia, and so on....this hypocrisy annoys me."
notsarc,Because it shows that Ockham was arguing against what Hi_Its_Me says the Razor is.
notsarc,**   This is the best response you've got!?! What a loser!!
notsarc,"ICBM, but I believe the termites make up the largest land-based biomass on earth."
notsarc,"So now Wiesmann's barrier is the most important thing to the ToE? Somehow I doubt that biologists agree, but obviously creationists have more authority on the topic of evolution..."
notsarc,They were both created on the sixth day according to Genesis 1.
notsarc,"Doctors ARE schooled in nutrition, however inadequately, this doesn't mean they're going to recommend crackpot ""raw food"" dietary schemes to prevent destructive ""lamarckian evolution"" on the basis of a single flawed experiment on cats."
notsarc,"Your right, this is not complete free will. But as I mentioned before, if you give yourself free will, then you are saying God has no control over you or your actions -- and therefore he is not God anymore."
notsarc,"I will agree science has disproven the literal reading of a number of different scriptures, such as the literal reading of Genesis (which was never meant to be literal to begin with, but that is a different matter).It also might explain why spiritiual beliefs exist for people.However, when it comes to this vaguly defined entity that alledgely created the universe, science has nothing to say about the existance of this alledged supernatural being."
notsarc,"Last time I checked, it was a debate about religion and evolution co-existing. Not a debate about Creationism vs. ""science"" and ""reality""."
notsarc,"Yes the facts speak for themselves, they just don't sing the song you think they do. No biologist will find any need at all to wave any hands in this instance, for as you say the facts DO speak for themselves."
notsarc,Like most things theists that statement is based on ignorance.
notsarc,"I think we should not spend inordinate amount of resources on trying to determine who is homeless and if it his own fault. Anyway, whose business is it where someone lives?"
notsarc,"What possible concern is any of that to you?    Some actually search for knowledge through debate. This is a debate forum if you recall. Don't play if you're not so inclined but to post warnings not to fall in this trap, c'mon."
notsarc,"Yes I know, a lot of people have done a lot of work to try to refute Behe's work. From your link;"
notsarc,"Now you're being ridiculous. The big bang is not the evolution of the universe. The words ""evolution of the universe"" do not necessarily entail the big bang. For example, brane theory offers an alternative theory to explain the evolution of the universe.But claiming that the ""evolution of the universe"" is part of the theory of evolution is somewhat like claiming that because Kate Hudson has achieved stardom, she is producing vast amounts of energy through hydrogen fusion. Why is it that creationists believe that every word has only a single meaning?By the way, I have always heard the creationist invention ""GTE"" referred to as the General Theory of Evolution - you know, as if there is some relation to the general theory of relativity."
notsarc,Well i know it wouldn't be sensible for anyone to call my child an it that is just disrespectfull to both your partener and child.
notsarc,"Because I don't feel like copying and pasting articles into a forum when they can be easily accessed online. But for a quick summary: The CCR-5 gene mutation is present in about 15% of caucasians, with 1% having the homogeneous version. These 1% are completely immune. The heterogeneous people possess some immunity."
notsarc,"Being refuted by organized groups with an agenda they support does not make Supwersports ideas wrong. You call it garbage. I AM interested in what Supersport thinks about how his ideas will get wider respect and how he thinks this will change our society.I think this is an important question, because otherwise posting here seems like a kind of mutual masterbation trading facts and arguments that have no effect.Until I hear from SS, I give him the benefit of the doubt."
notsarc,For once I agree with you. Your wrong on your thoughts and views with evolution but your right in saying that abortion is wrong.
notsarc,But isn't that the problem? This creationist decided that science should be limited to his religion. He's afraid of flying.
notsarc,"It's all in how you word the questions.You worded the questions with an obvious bias, they did not come across as an honest attempt to learn, but rather as a challenge.Word them properly, and I guarantee you that the people here will be most helpful.WaxyP.S. Your username has a large affect on how you are initially perceived."
notsarc,"I am so sorry to hear about what has happened to you. I hope you get away from this terrible man and surround yourself with people who love you.I must ask, though, why are you a Christian? You completely disagree with typical Christian sentiments on abortion, you feel none of the purported guilt the religious movement implies is inevitable, you feel like you did the right thing, so why would you continue to profess to belong to this religion if you disagree with one of the major issues of the day?"
notsarc,"Yes California is following European socialism. Just like socialist Europe, they are going broke. Socialism depends on large income taxes to fund social programs. Try the same taxes here in the USA and people will get thier guns and shoot all the politicians trying to tax them. Remember this country was born over a fight over taxes."
notsarc,The article is saying that it was genetic changes. Changes in genes encoding certain transcription factors is what caused changes in the expression of other genes.
notsarc,"so if cells are controlled by their genes (and the environment), what would you predict would happen to the cell if its genes were removed?"
notsarc,"I think that the bad guys will be happy if any gun control law goes into effect, because then there will be less chance of the victum having a weapon for their defense, and the crime rate will rise!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
notsarc,"Well, first, those were Hebrews, not Christians. Secondly, the scripture doesn't say they raped them, it says ""keep them for yourselves."" That could mean rape, however, I'm pretty sure that was not Moses's intention. Also, the Hebrews considered it impure to lie with non-Hebrew women or men, so if there was any sexual immorality going on it was very small. However, that DOESN'T mean it was justified or right."
notsarc,"Demographics plays a role, but it does not explain away the whole shift in the numbers."
notsarc,"While the current cannon was 'accepted' by the late second century, there were numerous other 'gospels' that existed by then, and were eliminated at the 4th century time frame. Most of those copies were destroyed, but some have been unearthed."

notsarc,So why are you here? Do you have anything to offer of any substance?
notsarc,"Actually, Galileo wasn't killed. He was sentenced to house arrest. And his sin was in declaring that the earth moved since the Bible states that the earth doesn't move."
notsarc,"That's is ridiculously poor logic. Simply becuase the church makes mistakes doesn't mean it's incorrect in all other charges. The US government is WAY more corrupt than the Catholic Church, and yet we obey every god-damned thing big brother makes us do."
notsarc,"""Supposedly""? You ran from those threads. You are the one making assertions that you don't back up. You are the one unwilling (i.e. unable) to show that Arctic foxes can adapt to a Phoenix summer. You are the one who keeps ignoring (what I will henceforth refer to as) The Chihuahua Challenge. For somebody claiming to be so clearly right and so obviously vindicated by the evidence, you've done nothing to show it, and you've done everything to run from it."

notsarc,"Regardless of the name change, the calendars are still keyed on the birth and death of Christ...and that will be so at least until the atheists are able to come up with another numbering system and force it on everyone else just to pacify their own baby mentalities."
notsarc,"Actually, I snipped your remarks because 1) you twisted what I said and 2) I'm already spending too much time arguing with random complainers and I was in a hurry to do something more important at the time."
notsarc,"Only approximate and really depends upon what day you start counting, before or after menses."
notsarc,"oh, now we're getting somewhere. Explain more, please. Oh, and some evidence of incremental modifications would be nice too."
notsarc,"Why do people on the pro-gun side continuously try to oversimplify the issue? No one is really arguing that there would be zero murder without guns. The question is would there be less murders without guns. In developed nations with stricter gun laws there are less murders. At any rate, I don't think you can draw such conclusions based on one incident."
notsarc,"well heck, if lifeforms cannot realistically be strung together by small, gradual, materialist increments (which they can't and there is no evidence for) then the only alternative is special creation."
notsarc,"I wish you guys would quit trying to ""muddy the waters"" by introducing facts that contradict my claims, innuendo, cliches and WAG. - signed X gazer"
notsarc,You mean to tell me it's a falsehood??   I don't believe it.
notsarc,"It is pretty bizzare. There are plenty of groups out there that will reach whatever ""conclusion"" you pay them to reach. Why he didn't cite one of them instead of an easily checkable source that says the opposite of what he says they do is beyond me."
notsarc,Because Humphreys went out looking? How many should we allegedly find?
notsarc,"I'll address the later question. They may not ""need"" teeth that big, I couldn't say. Just because a creature has a feature doesn't mean its necessary or useful. While evolution does select for useful traits and against harmful traits, that doesn't mean that a trait won't develop that is simply odd. As long as it isn't particularly negative there's no reason to assume it will go away, and so sometimes you get traits that aren't ""useful"", they're simply not harmful. Those teeth could be such a case."
notsarc,"I have posted responses to Demon38's earlier post. I have offered DNA findings as evidence to begin with. It is not my evidence, but scientific evidence. That is the only evidence that I will provide in this discussion. I think there is ample evidence to cause scientists to rethink their theories, evidence that they do not want to accept because it puts certain hypothesis they have advanced in a poor light."
notsarc,And the comments section is usually where the real comedy lies.
notsarc,But wouldn't it make it more likely that a gun dealer that was involved in gun trafficking would be audited and caught by the ATF? If there are less FFLs then the ATF has more time to monitor and inspect each gun dealer.
notsarc,I think an open mind is the best thing to have when it comes to theories. I think there is some truth in everything.
notsarc,"Again, it's not the point. There are many who don't deny evolution, they believe it was guided. Showing examples of guidence - through artificial selection supports this theory"

notsarc,not according the SCJ of Mass. This was part of the grounds of their ruling FOR marriage in Mass.
notsarc,"And that is meaningless babble. Evolution is a process that has been observed whether you like it or not. It is not a moral statement nor is it a statement of faith. It does not deal with government, laws or culture. Whining about it won't change it."
notsarc,"No, the question is why you let violent individuals remain free in public."
notsarc,"So what if the author isn't arguing against gun control? At last, there is indication that England has taken a step in the right direction and realized that taking all guns away from everybody isn't the answer to crime."
notsarc,"Because the location of the tracks used to be a tidal plane. In other words, it used to be at the edge of the ocean. Around that time the sea coast advanced and receded several times. The tracks were buried. The tracks actually had to be uncovered. The tracks were originally discovered immdiately after an unusually severe storm in the area in which an unusual amount of water came down the Paluxy. That unusual flow of water washed away the soil that covered some of the tracks. Other tracks have been intentionally uncovered. For example, in one case, where a trackway went under a bank, several feet of the bank was removed to expose more tracks."
notsarc,Because it will encourage teens to engage in riskier behavior. Abstinence until marriage is still the best way.
notsarc,"again, please explain what possible benefits you forsee with teaching intelligent design. Please show me where it is anything than a belief. Evolution was always considered science. It used the scientific method, and offered evidence for everyone to see and peer review. Until the ""theory"" of intelligent design does that, I will always be forced to put quotes around the word theory, because it will simply be a religious belief."
notsarc,"""A story in some early editions of yesterday's Daily News incorrectly reported that gun-control advocate Sarah Brady may have skirted Delaware's gun laws when she bought a rifle for her adult son but did not declare who was going to own the weapon.""The Delaware Department of Justice initially insisted to The News that gun purchasers must declare who the weapon was intended for so that person's background could be checked. Yesterday, a spokeswoman for the Delaware Department of Justice said it misinterpreted the law and that Brady was not obligated to state that the gun was for her son as long as he was legally qualified to own a firearm.""In addition, a spokesman for Brady said, 'Sarah Brady told the gun store that the gun was for her son and filled out the forms that they asked her to fill out.'""The News regrets the error.""CORRECTION"
notsarc,"It is in the first place unclear to whom the ""further harm"" is done. But even granting that the fetus dies, it is not clear how the situation is analogous to abortion, because the intentions of not only the man but even more importantly of the pregnant woman are completely different."
notsarc,"In 2000, the U.S. recorded close to 11,000 firearm homicides and more than 16,000 firearm suicides. The European Union -- an area with a population approximately 25% higher than that of the U.S. -- reported fewer than 1,300 firearm homicides for the same year. In Japan, the number was 22.sinjin - The US firearm homicide rate is more than 180x that of Japan."

notsarc,"If information came into being by chance, how can we know that anything is true? How do you know what is false and what is ""true""? If we are just products of chance, your brain is also a product of chance. Therefore, the thought patters that determine your logic are also products of chance. If your logic is the result of chance processes, you can't even be sure it evolved properly. You can't even be sure you can reason properly (using your definition) because you can't trust your own logic.As for the second part, no, you've got it backward, rational belief is based on faith in a rational creator.

notsarc,"The difference, Eddie is simply this. If the Constitution needs to be changed, the founders instigated a means to do so. Said means is doubly hard as to make sure what is done, has been given much thought and study. The plan afoot today by the Gun Grabbers is to incrementally usurp the rights of free men, until, the fait accompli has been established. If the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, or any of the other rights guaranteed by the Constitution are to be abridged, they must ne done so by legal means, i.e. constitutional amendment."
notsarc,"ToE is a mechanistic theory -- it says life is like a machine. Machines aren't intelligent, they just do what they're made/programmed to do. Darwinists say lifeforms do what they do because of the way their particular genes program them. This is basic stuff.....yet you come along and say this isn't so. So which is it? Is life intelligent or not? If it is intelligent, what is illogical about believing life was designed intelligently by an intelligent designer? The intelligence had to come from somewhere. Where did the information in the DNA code come from?"
notsarc,"Not if they give him the death penalty, then it's apeals till your ears bleed."
notsarc,"Not quite.

You don't have the right to win a revolt."

Women did not have a choice in whether their pregnancies were terminated or not which, having it, is the definition of the PC point of view. So no, they were NOT Pro-choice."
notsarc,"The memo is real, nobody has ever been able to disprove it. Handgun Control Inc. (the people who later became the Brady Campaign) have claimed that the memo is a hoax and that what was released has never been their official position. However them simply stating this, is no different than Obama making a statement on national news, and then several months later saying ""I never said that"" and trying to reverse his position.Until it can be proven beyond doubt as being untrue and simple propaganda, the memo is real and explains in detail exactly what the gun control groups are after."
notsarc,"Not all evolution takes place over billions of years. There has been speciation that we have actually seen occuring within a few years at a time. ""bacteria, birds etcs.""Natural selection occures frequently. You can ""observe"" evolution through the fossile record, DNA, morphology etcs.Evolution has made predictions, these predictions have come true, ergo, it's good."
notsarc,"Yep. But our ancestors lived in an area of abundant fruit, and we got all we needed from our diets, so it was no big thing when the gene broke. A few non-primate organisms also have it broken, but it's broken in a different way.Barbarian observes:It's remarkable then, how much progress we've made. You may or may not approve of the theory, but it works very well at learning more about biology."
notsarc,"Then for you, you made the right decision at the time. I'd personally have been leary of not getting to work or go to school easily from the doctors statements, especially in regards to keeping the child."
notsarc," I know a bit about this myself.  However the difference is that I was allowed to carry a gun under the reasonable man statute. An Armed person truly cannot be bullied! The old saying is. God created man and Samuel Colt made them equal! Old, disabled, female and all, are on an equal footing with these vicious predators!"
notsarc,You have any examples of that? Shooting people for throwing rocks and eggs at houses that is.
notsarc,"What we have here is simply a perspective problem, which is the problem with most debates. I see the Bible as sound, and every ""error"" in the Bible I have researched (I have admittedly not researched them all) have been refuted."
notsarc,"I think they have more of a chance becasue, while many manage to delude themselves into believing that an unborn child is not a baby, it would be much more difficult to convince yourself that a crying baby isn't a baby. Even in the animal kingdom (which we are all part of) you see some animals hesitate to kill the young of their own species. Evne coyotes will not generally kill a pup (I have even seen a pack of coyoptes pass a domestic pup without killing it, though they could have. I am told this is because of the stubby nose, which shows the coyotes that it is, indeed, a puppy, even though it looks unfamiliar to them)."
notsarc,"Actually, no. If it had not been for the gay couples and the organizations who helped them fight for equality it wouldn't be an issue now, but it would still be an issue."
notsarc,"So God gets to do these terrible things, but He gets a free pass because He's God?Kinda funny what happens when you show Archie that the Bible doesn't even support his beliefs, isn't it guys?I still like the fact that the Bible says not to count children under one month of age as persons, yet here Archie expects us to count a zygote as ""a human life."""
notsarc,"Well, thank you for this thread Santafeur. I must say though that I peruse various threads just to read stuff. The C vs. E topic does not strike a nerve with me. In fact, I also wonder what it is about the human mind that makes people so desperate to want to know how we came about. What difference does it make? We are here now. Could we possibly just accept that we got here somehow, and just move on?"
notsarc,"This statement is wrong. People from hundreds of years before Jesus was born prophesied that a baby would be born, in Bethlehem, of a virgin. There were over 50 more prophesies that were made about his life, and the sacrafice he made to pay for the sins of man, and the bigest one of all...He completely fufilled scripture when he rose from the dead. These men were inspired by Jesus, God, how can you argue that he is not the christ? The odds of one man filling all the prophesies is impossible. And these scriptures have been unchanged for the past 2000-2500 approx years! Thats proof for me that Jesus existed and that he is God. PM me if you like."
notsarc,"(My evidence does not require this quote, it's for comparison only)The theory of evolution is based on evidence, the existence of god, is not..Reason cannot be applied to it. Furthermore, since evolution relies on reason, faith cannot be applied to it. To attempt to label science as a faith is a contradiction. I know it irks you that your faith cannot be proven, but that's the definition of faith!! It wouldn't be faith without it. As Montalban says in a contradiction of motives: His particular faith does not rest on the foundations of [reason]. Why then look for support from reason?"
notsarc,From your own link it is very clear the NRA DID NOT say that or publish that. Your clearly very wrong.
notsarc,And I would agree with you as long as all marriages for all couples were called civil unions and there is no two tiered system.

notsarc,"It would be 'an' analogy, but like the language analogy, it has its limitations.It is interesting to note that creationist computer software developers/programmers cannot seem to agree on the implications of 'mutations' when using such analogies - one such person, C.K. Lester, declared that computer programs can accumulate up to 30% 'random change', just like DNA (hypothetically) can, therefore, the computer analogy is a good one. But programmer R. David Pogge declares that even a single altered bit in a line of computer code a million bits in length would destroy it."
notsarc,"Because the Iliad and Odyssey do not claim to be divine does not mean they should be placed under a different threshold as the Bible. Otherwise, it's special pleading on your part, and thus logically fallacious. This is one of many inconsistencies between skeptics in regards to the scrutiny of the Bible. They are unwilling to put the standards they have on the Bible against other books similar in age. If they did, there would not be a single book left standing."
notsarc,Not the way I see it from my experiences. I let the readers decide on their own. 
notsarc,"No one said he invented guns!A straw man argument is an informal fallacy based on misrepresentation of an opponent's position.[1] To ""attack a straw man"" is to create the illusion of having refuted a proposition by substituting a superficially similar proposition (the ""straw man""), and refuting it, without ever having actually refuted the original position.[1][2]"
notsarc,"Actually, it's not conjecture. The genetic makeup of the several subspecies of arctic foxes bear it out. The dominant allele is rare because it is less adaptive. The dominant allele is most likely ancestral. But even foxes below the Arctic circle show differences in their fur between summer and winter. So yes, foxes that were able to change color in the north had a differential reproductive advantage over those who couldn't."
notsarc,"Schumer is a bonafide idiot, as are many in the Senate. He failingly tried to draw Alito into exposing how he would rule on abortion if presented a case. Alito is far too intelligent to be logically trapped by a buffoon such as Shumer.It is also plain to see he interrupts when he supposes the response will indeed make sense against his flailings."
notsarc,"And as their populations grew over thousands of years, civilizations seperate out and independent nations form, laws are set up, and some prosper while others wallow in poverty, how long do you think it will take until people begin to kill each other on your peaceful planets? Nice dream, but real life does not work like that."
notsarc,"Hey, as Collin said, P.Z. registered, and got it. I would say that booting him out is the height of hypocrisy. It confirms to be that it is based on a lie, and the producer knows it. The movie was making a claim that the 'opposition' was silencing I.D., and the presentation of alternate ideas. Yet, what do they do? They kicked someone out they INTERVIEWED for the movie (based on false pretenses to be sure, but they did pay him for appearing in the movie).That sounds that THEY are the ones trying to suppress opposing ideas, not science. Yes, they had the legal right. But, boy did it put egg on their face, considering everything. It shows them to be hypocrites and liars."
notsarc,Straw man. I am not attacking the achievements of science. I am attacking the notion that you have that scientists are exempt from the catalogue of influences that affect everyone else; with only the slightest admission of a tiny possibility of cultural influence - which was quickly dismissed anyway with the false analogy of comparing evolution to aeronautical engineering.
notsarc,If you paid attention the BATFE said so.       Yes but some people don't want to close the borders. They prefer no border controls.
notsarc,"But it really does deal with thinking. It can invite a more wide open scientific investigation of ecological and developmental patterns. It's not politically afraid to pursue facts about newly discovered complexities of life which pose problems for those trying to make a case for happenstance origins. It invites thought, not suppression, of irreducible complexity, another problem for happenstance origins. "
notsarc,"That's because these questions were never, ever, EVER raised in the original Parker case. None of the six DC people who took the city to court possessed a felony record, they didn't bring up anything other than the fact that DC made it impossible for them to legally buy and own a handgun. That's all the court addressed. If they addressed anything else in the Heller case it would've been judicial activism, legislating from the bench."
notsarc,I don't agree with this debate. If preventing the Devil from interfering on earth should not be prevented by God then why is it that God did prevent the Devil from interfering in heaven after he was defeated? They are both essentially taking the Devil away from an area where he could potentially harm those that are good. God seemingly saw fit for one to occur but not the other. Why would that be?
notsarc,"This is why arguments like ""well, our population is out of control"" never convince ANY Pro-Life advocate that abortion is okay. I think it is amusing when pro-choice people use such arguments... Pro-Lifers have a priority list, and Life makes it to the top. For Pro-Lifers, it's a little like saying ""Well, Big Macs taste good, so you should never, ever eat filet mignon since burgers taste good!"" I mean, sure, burgers taste good, but filet mignon is so much better."
notsarc,But the military is pretty much all a volunteer thing. It's not a hiring process--employer/employee thing. That arrangement lends itself more to the soldier not volunteering for service in the first place.

notsarc,And how does this compare to your ideas on artificial selection?
notsarc,Sounds like the Brady Law has stopped a lot of criminals from obtaining handguns.
notsarc,Finally someone answered the question. Thanks. I thought it might be the government.Does your government attempt to do this?What do you think about other democratic nations that have citizens that are less armed? Do you think that they're in danger - or is it only the American government that's out to do this?
notsarc,Incorrect- I think Olsen is very specific in citing those he feels have overstepped the mark in this instance. He is not ruling out the possibility of a link at all- he (rightly IMO) is targeting certain workers and publications.
notsarc,"As was pointed out in some of your own quotations, survival is not an 'end' of natural selection. Natural selection is the differential reproductive success of organisms with more favorable suites of characteristics. It is a statistical tendency. Individual organisms may work to survive, but they also work to reproduce. That's as close as it gets to ""purpose."" And as you know, Darwin's favored term was natural selection. He never used the phrase ""survival of the fittest"" without also making a reference to natural selection. The opposite is not the case. Since Darwin's time ""survival of the fittest"" has been rejected by evolutionary biologists because it is such a poor representation of the extent of the theory."
notsarc,"Actually, it's true. One Darwin's basic ideas upon which he based the theory of natural selection."
notsarc,You weren't referring to your home in your little story of helplessness.
notsarc,"No, there really aren't. As for Robertson, why do you think I said he was right (as in global warming is happening and we are largely responsible) by sheer luck?"
notsarc,"your probably referring to the mexican basin crater. mass extinction doesn't prove evolution. the flood as described in the Bible is an example of mass extinction. besides, in order for the asteroid theory to work, the asteroid would have to create an almost global tidal wave that would effectively kill the animals by drowning. also similiar to the effects of the flood."
notsarc,"Well, I personally agree that I 'spanked' marc9000 (http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=6348). But we'll have to leave it to the judges to make the formal decision."
notsarc,"The anti-abortionists claim a load of **** on many issues. I don't listen to them. To put the ""life"" of an unfertilized egg above that of a person is grotesquely sick IMO. I support any such stem cell research wholeheartedly."
notsarc,"You forgot to fully quote John 8:18. here is the rest: and the Father that sent Me beareth witness of Me. He isn't bearing witness to Himself here. Two witnesses are, one of which is Himself, which is why He said in John 8:17 It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true. John 5:30-32 is saying this exact same thing. "
notsarc,"Well said. Most Americans favor more gun control, but unfortunately this majority of Americans tends not to vote based on the issue of gun control while a very vocal minority composed of gun activists definitely does vote based on the issue. This is something politicians have realized since 1994 so they have been more hesitant to support gun control. There probably will be more gun control supporters in office in the coming years but I'm not sure how much this will change things."
notsarc,It's not about how she treated cops. It's about how cops treated her as an American citizen with rights.
notsarc,What does being a priest have to do with anything? It wouldn't matter if he were a Satan worshipper.
notsarc,"I'm not claiming any omnipotent deciever. I'm not sure where you derive 'probability' from, or how you can have any degree of certainty over your past experiences or those of other consciousnesses.And in any case, saying 'it hasn't happened yet' is hardly logical proof."
notsarc,"Forgive me if this seems picky, but I just want to try and fully understand this argument. I should say that I don't necessarily agree with it, and would like to respond as to why. I just want to give a proper representation of your argument so that I can make a sound response.As such, you can no more force her, against her will, to provide bodily resources to an embryo or fetus, than you can yourself be forced to give of your bodily resources against your will.... Where does this right originate from, i.e., is it from the US Constitution via the 14th amendment etc?"
notsarc,So a theory was revised... does that mean that it was wrong afterwards?
notsarc,He didn't! I hope you reported that to the admin
notsarc,Don't expect your misrepresentations of the findings of those studies to sink in. I'm not that easily fooled.
notsarc,"Form 4473, question 11a reads as follows:11.a. Are you the actual buyer of the firearm(s) listed on this form? Warning: You are no the actual buyer if you are acquiring the firearm(s) on behalf of another person. If you are not the actual buyer, the dealer cannot transfer the firearm(s) to you.Sarah Brady lied on the background check form, she bought the gun on behalf of her son and supplied it to him, thus ensuring that he wouldn't have to worry about the NICS check red flagging him. By gun control standards she's guilty of a straw purchase and should've been sentenced to ten years without parole in a federal prison."
notsarc,But the point is why are there relatively few creationists. The reason is that the creationist position cannot be defended in open debate. That is why creationist boards censor opposing views. On boards where creationists are not protected there are few.
notsarc,"So it's the blog's fault that Miller sided with the creationists. Right-o, marc. (I suspect you haven't even read the blog entry in question; I'd be surprised if you've read more than a paragraph of PZ's blog.. ever.)"
notsarc,"That's fair enough, but I just think it's important to at least acknowledge and realize that the unborn baby does have worth and importance, and not just a piece of tissue as it's so often callously viewed."
notsarc,"And if they are governed and regulated people can be victimized by the system. In fact, the regulation might be the very thing victimizing people. Again, it isn't the system but the people who are in society that make a morality."

notsarc,you should be allowed to buy as many as you want to
notsarc,"Well, yes. Eleven years is quite swift, but it actually supports the theory of evolution through natural selection. The estimates of the speed of evolution that you seem to be depending on were done by George Gaylord Simpson way back in the 1940s or 1950s. Since then, we have observed fruit flies, as well as other specimens, to evolve quite rapidly, showing significant evolution in only a decade or so. More recently, however, scientists have been able to observe evolution in natural settings and have found that it can sometimes be quite rapid when environmental change is rapid. Besides the studies that Reznick did on guppies, there are also the studies of the Galapagos finches by the grants, and studies of anole lizards in the Bahamas. These are observable phenotypical changes, not speciation events."
notsarc,"No, I mean evolution, in which statistically random variation is but one factor. It's a terrible mistake to equate evolution with pure chance."
notsarc,So they had guns that could shoot down planes even before they had planes?   Their primitive muskets were that powerful? I am not that easy to fool!
notsarc,"You did when you talked about someone loving objects, or a mokey, etc."
notsarc,"A lot of work has been done on that topic. I would recommend reading Debating Design from Darwin to DNA It is a monster of a book, but it is definitely worth the read."
notsarc,"Yes I do understand this. But you must admit that the instantaneous formation of a living organism, even an extremely primitive one, complete with the complexity of the DNA code as a result of random encounters of atoms and molecules is a little too much to buy. There is evidence right there for creationism. Only intelligence could have formed such an elaborate complex system for the structure of life and its propagation. "
notsarc,"So any long publication must be due to a panic attack? It takes a few minutes to read those posts, but it takes an hour and a half to watch Expelled; does that mean that IDers are having the mother of all panic attacks?Your logic can't even be described as ""tortured,"" marc, because it's completely nonexistent."
notsarc,That's right. It merely has the capacity to make errors which sometimes slightly improves function in a particular environment. And those tend to accumulate over time.
notsarc,"Exactly. If you are a child rapist and someone pops you in the head than you should go to jail for murder. Sorry, two wrongs don't make a right."
notsarc,"So what's the deal when GWB ""gives"" $3,000 but the insurance premiums cost $6,000, the family can't make up the difference and the $3,000 goes unspent. All we've accomplished is to transfer $ out of the U.S. Treasury. You think it's a good idea to just give money away and not get anything for it? You're thinking of the Clinton years when there was a surplus."
notsarc,Might be something to be said for that. Are there any studies that show possible causes of suicide?
notsarc,"Not at all. The issue is receiving the marriage benefits. If gays were given all of the benefits of marriage for just living together, we wouldn't have a fight at all as you would have gotten what you want. It isn't the marriage that is important to you but the benefits. And the debate in Italy of singles who live together seeking marriage benefits also is a good example of the can of worms that will be opened if society concedes to the gay crusaders the undue rights they are demanding.Why is it absolutely impossible for you to reply to an issue without first redefining it to fit your warped World view? Have you no objectivity within you at all?"
notsarc,Umm...thats the point of saying God of the Gaps - when science fills in the gaps then there is less for your God to do.
notsarc,"Because natural selection works on a cost/benefit basis. For bats and whales and cave-dwelling birds echolocation confers huge advantage, allowing them to exploit niches closed to competing species. For ground- or tree-dwelling terrestrial animals, it would be of marginal or zero benefit, given the 'noise' in their immediate surroundings."
notsarc,"this is totally false. the laws of logic being absolute does nothing to support a case for god. in fact, everything the bible tells us about god's nature indicates that god is illogical, unpredictable, unreliable and irreplicable. this is totally the opposite of logic"
notsarc,But does anyone actually need a marriage to do this? No.   Are there any laws stating one must be married before giving birth? No.
notsarc,"Not realy they are still being manufactured for civilian use and are legal in most states even in states where machine guns are not allowed. You would be actualy supprised at how available they are. You sign your life away and are no longer a name less face to the feds but you may be able to own one in your state. All thats needed is to get your chief law enforcment officer to sign your fourm 4, pay $200 to BATFE, pass an FBI back ground chk and wait appx. 2 mo's and you have one."
notsarc,Good old monkeys! What can't we learn from them :)Since we are in the Creation vs Evolution section I'm guessing that your debate here is that monkeys and humans show some similar ways of thinking such as in this experiment. It does seem like further evidence that evolution did take place between our two species although it isn't a case cracker by any means.
notsarc,just cause you dont buy it doesnt mean it is not true. that life is sacred does provide a (if not the only) compelling altruistic basis for and responsibility to social justice whether it is actually walked out or not. I think that the fact that it is not really walked out in america proves that the majority of americans are not pro life (including a majority of those who actually claim to be pro life). This doesnt negate the truth though.
notsarc,"The other articles on her website are also well worth reading: Musings on Christianity, Homosexuality & the Bible"

notsarc,"addition works in the intangible as well. 1 minute + 1 minute = 2 minutes. 1 idea + 1 idea = 2 ideas. the concept of quantity is not limited to matter. if there was just a vaccous void were absolutely nothing was happening, then there would be no application of logic. but even that in itself would be logical. nothing + nothing = nothing is logical. it would actually be logical if a void with nothing added to it result in something. so even in a void, logic still prevails"

notsarc,Prove your assertion that he has called himself a conservative Christian rather than a conservative Republican OP. Support your clai if you can or stop trying to lump everyone on the right together.
notsarc,"Actually, it is quite correct. You misunderstand. The text book was trying to make it simple so that you would understand. The text book wasn't simple enough. The first record of carbonaria was in 1848. The discussion you quote was trying to explain quite simply, so that you might understand why the change took place. There is no record of anyone ever seeing a carbonaria before 1848. It is probably a safe assumption that an occasional mutation caused some to be born from time to time, but they were not able to reproduce to the extent that they were ever noted before 1848."
notsarc,"Define ""many"". What you really mean one is too much. Even when the one is used soles for personal defense. Besides your in Austraila, no one cares what you think."
notsarc,"And the follow-on that Archie throws out there demonstrates his ignorance on the subject.Such laws DO NOT just protect homosexuals.They protect EVERYBODY from being fired just cause they are gay OR straight (or bisexual or nonsexual).It protects the straights just as much as it protects the gays.It has nothing to do with ""better than"" or ""superior"".If people like Archie understood legislation like ENDA, they wouldn't try to make such an absurd allegation! emoticonXEmbarrassed"
notsarc,"You have this habit of making sweeping claims with little to no substantiation.And even if we were to completely ignore LeVay altogether, there is MOUNDS of other evidence showing a genetic cause.Like I keep pointing out, but nobody on your side of the fence seems to realize, NARTH's OWN CITED REFERENCES say there is a genetic cause!"
notsarc,Could it be that the Supreme Court does not view the right protected by the Second Amendment as being fundamental? This is the same court that said that only guns in common use are protected by the Second Amendment. That tells me the Supreme Court doesn't think the right to bear arms is as fundamental as other rights protected by the Bill of Rights. The protection of a newspaper by freedom of the press does not depend on the newspaper being in common use.

This is why I insist upon your defining the terms you're using."
notsarc,"You are a known anti-gun supporter, should we really be surprised at your presidential choice. Funny thing is, you are going to get screwed just like the rest of us if Obama wins. He might try to take our guns away, but your rights that are important to you wont be very far behind."
notsarc,So what this guy is saying is that he believes in natural selection but not evolution?
notsarc,"This is a pretty loose definition.It's like saying you have faith that Jesus will come again because you personally witnessed his ressurection.But you didn't, you have faith because you believe this with absolutely no material evidence or logic to back it up."
notsarc,"Well, I have heard people on the pro-gun side say that most defensive gun uses don't involve firing even one round. So limiting the capacity would probably have less of an effect on the ability to defend yourself than on crime. So why are people from the gun lobby always whining about restrictions like this? When semi-automatic rifles were banned in Australia, hunters welcomed the law. They saw it as a challenge because it takes greater skill to shoot an animal with a bolt action rifle. Not so in America where some gun owners like to use guns that could take down planes to shoot small animals."
notsarc,"Simone is quite right...women will no longer breed to order according to the dictats of outdated religion. British Muslim women will follow at some point (many already are). There are a few hothead extremists who sit on London street corners with placards stating that ""UK will be Islamic"", ""Sharia Law for UK"" etc. etc. But those nutters are ignored along with all the other (non-religious) nutters currently walking the streets of London. (For the record, Muslims make up 2.1 per cent of the total United Kingdom population. They are hardly ""taking over"" ).""muslims are taking over the world"" is a poor excuse of a reason to be anti-abortion and shows desperation, IMO!"
notsarc,And he has still yet to provide one. If more gun-control means more lives saved then more gun-control means more self preservation.
notsarc,And thats factually (and logically incorrect). There are many alternatives virtually an infinitude of them in fact.
notsarc,And I don't expect you to. The reason you won't go into how all men were created equal during reconstruction is because you cannot prove that all men are not created equal.
notsarc,"When it comes to all the examples that Behe had provided in both his first book, and his second book , it has been shown to be able to evolve naturally.   That means, in principle, IC systems can evolve. If you don't believe so, bring forth the I.C. system of your choice.   To say 'But you don't know all the answers' is just the logical fallacy known as 'argument from ignorance'.   Behe brings a system up that he claims is IC.. the pathway for evolution is discovered, and Behe trys another one. How dishonest can you get?   The concept is falsified."
notsarc,"why the comparison of gun owners yo violent killers and serial rapists? What law have I broken? Since we are doing comparisons your anti-freedom agenda is very similar to the bazi gun control laws of the 1930s, it is like the jim crow laws of the US. Your agenda is one of racism. This is insulting, ignorant, and shows your true colors as an enemy of freedom."
notsarc,"No it didn't, there's no suggestions for how to enforce background checks to stomp out straw purchases. Stop offering non-solutions."
notsarc,"You can have reasoned faith, but it need not rely on 'empirical' evidence. There are very many forms of evidence."
notsarc,"I think you fail to take into account that for most opposers of abortion, they genuinely feel they are trying to save lives by their opposition. In many cases it's not a matter of trying control sexual prermissiveness in society but preventing lives from being killed. Disagree or not, you can't separate the anti-abortion message from the fact that it holds to the view that abortion is a form of murder."
notsarc,"Catholics have a different belief. The goal is to always save both mother and child. If the fetus dies during the attempt to save both, then that's what happens. For instance, with an ectopic pregnancy, the goal isn't to kill he fetus, the goal is to save both mother and fetus."
notsarc,Please off one scientific piece of evidence in support of biblical creation.
notsarc,"I responded to your posts on the thread of ""Lets discuss the actual..."" I suggest we continue that discussion there."

In areas of west Africa where malaria is endemic there is an allele of hemoglobin that confers resistance when heterozygous. In other environments that allele is not beneficial and is, in fact, deleterious. It is fatal when homozygous. Now according to evolutionary theory such an allele should decline where it offers no benefit. Studies show that this allele is less frequent by about 2 percentage points in Americans of west African ancestry."
notsarc,"The meticulously preserved, unchanging 66 Books of the Bible aren't compelling?"
notsarc,"And why would I be anti Christianity when I am Christian?   Oh and by the way to who ever it was who said I don't believe in Jesus, or something to that extent, I never said anything to that extent, you just made up what you wanted and got mad about it. I believe in the teachings of Jesus. Yes I'm betting your asking me how I know about his teachings if I have never read the bible, My mom is someone who has re-read the bible like 6 or 7 times. So she's told me all about it, and what its supposed to teach us."
notsarc,"Really! Then I assume that you have read Darwin - at least On the Origin of Species. Otherwise you are babbling. Please cite specific passages from Darwin's books where he made ""morals and ethics"" a joke. Please also do the same for the works of Dawkins. Your assertion presumes that you have read the works of both men."
notsarc,Because to not view it as sacred presents a greater potential for harm. People sometimes to take a disposable view of things that they consider unimportant. To view humanity as sacred helps protect humanity.
notsarc,"I'm not familiar with the book, so can't comment upon it first hand. However http://www.ncseweb.org/icons/ appears to have a detailed critique of the book and may be of interest to you too. As I say I haven't read the original so cannot judge the quality of the link I'm supplying, so apologies in advance if it grossly misrepresents Mr Well's case."
notsarc,"Really, with C being between 1/2 and 2 million defensive gun uses per year. Or perhaps the hundreds of millions of legal, non-defense related, gun uses per year. When you compare the number times a guns are used legally to the number of times they are used illegally, B becomes pretty insignificant."
notsarc,Proof? All I can think to say is that a mind is a terrible thing to waste.
notsarc,"Actually, I reported the real results of a study. Regular church attendees are twice as likely to vote Republican...etc., the conclusion was, however, meant to be a joke. Most got it, you didn't. emoticonXRolleyes"
notsarc,"But still, if you think there are rights in the bill of rights that is wrong, that should not be granted or guaranteed, it would be a viable option to vote for removing them.What debate are you trying to end here? The debate: 'do you want little or less gun-control'?"
notsarc,"Honestly I'm not sure if it was ever said in the Bible, but I sure have heard a lot of the Bible thumpers saying free will is a gift from God."
notsarc,Because the modern application of gun control is to target everyone. But that doesn't change the fact that gun control began as a purely racist concept.
notsarc,"Well of course everybody is entitled. But as history has shown many southern states in America chose to ignore the Constitution and deny black people their rights on the basis of their skin color, using the ""black codes"" enacted after the Civil War. If it weren't for the 14th Amendment that forced state governments to abide by the constitution, minorities would still be out in the cold.The only thing we've been over, is that government and gun control is racist, not the Second Amendment."
notsarc,"You realise I'm talking about if the burglar is running away, not the householder, right? Looking at it again I realise I may not have phrased it clearly enough. I'm saying that some of those ""violent"" crimes may simply have been burglars pegging it when disturbed."
notsarc,"And many of those countries are having problems with it. Furthermore, we aren't even proposing what other countries have."
notsarc,"Simply pointing out that swords cut in both directions.   Be that as it may, no one has refuted that there are more cases of Concealed Carry Permit holders who have gone off and assaulted people than there have been school shootings.   Care to try? Omegaman tried, failed, and went silent on the topic."
notsarc,"Well, I forgot to add one thing: a legal notice to the gov't about such behavior."
notsarc,"Well before there was a law someone came up with a difference, I didn't ask if they end result was the same, I asked if there was a difference in the two. Maybe a moral difference or something."
notsarc,Give it a rest... what is evident here is more coffeehouse vasilation on your part... no foam.
notsarc,"It is ALL repeated time after time, and time again then again. But you are correct.

notsarc,"It's all very interesting, but you left out a critical piece of information. You deliberately omitted the fact that most of the black victims were killed by fellow blacks. These weren't murders carried out by racist white guys, they're the examples of black on black violence."
notsarc,"Problem is, you think requiring a woman not to kill someone is ""treating them as breeding animals"". Kind of an odd thought."
notsarc,"I have heard that the USA spends around 40% (total) more on health care than Canada does. That would be impressive if it weren't for one fact. The USA has 900% of our population. It is your administration costs what are getting you the most. We only spend around 11% on administration while the USA spends around 25% of their health care dollars. We have a cap on how much a doctor can be sued for as well. Yes, our system isn't perfect, but it still works.Nearly 50 million Americans don't have health care at all, that is around 18% of your total population. This is quite shameful. As I've stated, the USA is the only Nation in the Industrialize world to not have universal health care."
notsarc,Are you saying that given enough time you can come with answers? That's a statement of faith.
notsarc,Brinks plays on people's fears to sell security systems that don't even work. Insurance companies play on people's fears to sell their policies.

notsarc,"I looked it up and apparently there is a synthetic form of THC on the market, (generically known as Dronabinol and sold under the trade name Marinol). But it is only allowed under restricted prescription (it's a Schedule II controlled substance, the same as morphine or cocaine) and is far less effective than plant-derived THC."
notsarc,Let me explain this to you.You want to stop abortions for someone else. You want to take a womans right to choose away. Where as Jito supporting a womans right to choose does not impose upon your life in any way.You want to stop me from being able to marry this does not effect your life in any way yet has a devastationg effect on my life. The left supports rights while your side want to limit the rights of others.You want to stop me from being able to marry because you have a religious belief against it even though I may have a religious belief that supports it. Therefore you are imposing your religious and moral views on me when I do not share those beliefs.
notsarc,"Actually, society hasn't said this. 5 judges, in very recent times, have. I for one think that some 17 year olds fully comprehend the full implications of murder, and therefore should be held accountable in the same way as an 18 year old. I guess I just don't see any reason why a jury could not address the issue on a case by case basis. I do not see the ""18 and over execution rule"" in the eighth amendment."
notsarc,Right. They can never show how the belief in their deity is not a textbook case of the special pleading fallacy. (Pretty funny after all the hubbub earlier about double standards...)
notsarc,"Because Africa isn't one big homogeneous ecosystem. There are jungles, plains, deserts, swamps. Himps living in the jungle weren't in competition with himps that started migrating out onto the plains. Their food sources are different, their territories are different. The more suited to plains-dwelling we became, the less attractive a prospect it was to return to the jungle. Pretty straightforward, really."
notsarc,I wouls also add that humans have been able to make CHIHUAHUAs and Irish wolf hounds from wolves.
notsarc,********. Utter fraking ****. Scientists have already accumulated mounds of evidence which suggest the common ancestor. You choose to ignore it as do most scientifically ignorant christians.
notsarc,"Yeah, it does have risk unlike the embryonic stem cells, but I think that if it comes out the way they hope, it will eventually lead to more embryonic uses as well when people realize that this can have risks. I think it is good to have this way as a back up while people argue over the use of cells that would otherwise be disposed, and get some treatment to people who need it rather than letting it be denied to them by anti-abortionists. And yeah, it's pretty much guaranteed that someone will find something to object about, claiming it is immoral (maybe it will now be that these stem cells are potential human life and we can't use them emoticonXRolleyes ), but it will likely not have as many objections."
notsarc,No contradiction; the Permian extinction was the most severe in history and noted as such in the page linked.
notsarc,"Of course not. That battle has already been lost. Creationism is religion and it cannot be taught in a science class, even when it is called ""creation science"" and the data is distorted and mininterpreted. The most recent attempt by creationists in Kansas on the State Board (and yes, they were YECs) was to eliminate all requirements to teach evolution, and all references to an old earth from all curriculum standards."
notsarc,"I believe in a strict interpretation of the Constitution, this makes me neither a liberal or conservative. The SN was inspired by VOR who kept signing his posts with quotes from Karl Marx."
notsarc,"Agreed that they are still the same species, much like the ""13 species"" of Darwin's Finches, and I have no problem with evolution in that respect. I can even see the plausibility of different subspecies evolving eventually into different species if they are geographically separated for a sufficiently long time. But I still don't see where evolution, in that sense of the term, can account for dozens of species of monkeys occupying the same patch of rainforest, or dozens of species of gazelles occupying the same patch of grassland."
notsarc,"The reported killings in European countries have rivaled the levels of Columbine. Quite a feat for a country with strict gun control laws. How can even a rare and isolated incident in a country with draconian gun control, meet or exceed something that's supposedly relatively common in America?"
notsarc,"And as such, the term as you use it is utterly meaningless as it could be applied to any cell or sell remnant of human origin."
notsarc,"A master baiter like you should present your thesis to be taken seriously, you haven't and you aren't. "
notsarc,"'Self-defense' never enters into it, imo. Unwillingness to share ones body is not necessarily self-defense, so this does not apply."
notsarc,You should have said that. I might have agreed with you.
notsarc,Wrong and no one has ever called bone marrow an inner sanctum and I don't know what a baby's tabernacle might be.
notsarc,"Almost all did. In fact, probably all that you are aware of did. Even the energy in the steak that you eat came from the sun ultimately. The thing is that evolution seems to have resulted in an organism to take advantage of almost every form of available energy. And what energy is left by ""higher"" animals is used by others - insects, microbes - until there is little usable energy left. That even goes so far that there are some organisms that get their energy from geothermal sources - no light involved."
notsarc,"AGREED!!!!That has to be BY FAR the best series I've ever read!Also, Asimov's Foundation triligoy is good. And again, the classics:Fahrenheit 4511984Catcher in the Rye...and all those other depressing books..."
notsarc,"And some of those tests fail. There are holes in the theory of gravity. Yet gravity remains fact in simple every day terms. Evolution is fact because ""we can observe it's effects on objects and we can do tests to determine more about it"". Further there are very few holes in that theory. Evolution is therefore more deserving of being called fact than gravity is. What I think you are really trying to say is that you can think you understand gravity (drop ball; ball falls) therefore you see it as a fact. But evolution is complex even at a basic level, so you do not see it as fact."
notsarc,"But the fact remains that guns are, by design, weapons."
notsarc,"very true. logic exists whether people are there to grasps its concepts or not.where we disagree is at your assumption that god created logic. how can this be? logic is not contingent on any intelligent entity, whether it be man or god, to exist. the logic of increasing a quantity by adding to it would remain whether god existed or not. you have yet to tie the existence of logic to god as its cause"
notsarc,Gun writer Jeff Snider point out. Obama: No AWB for Now?
notsarc,You misunderstand me I believe they should all be locked up. Anyone who preaches against gay people freely living their lives as equal citizens with all the rights and responsibilites should be locked up in the darkest dungeon. There can be no compromise on this issue peoples lives are at stake.
notsarc,"To force women to have babys that they dont even want is even more ""preposterous""."
notsarc,"I think hip hop and the arts are reflections of society. It is good to bring these issues to light, if only so that those who wouldn't normally be aware of them are enlightened."
notsarc,"What do you mean by this? Could we not have the law treat under-18 capital offenders on an individual basis, determining whether the individual offenders in the individual cases were sufficiently developed?Also, what would you say to the response that our current law provides that juveniles are sufficiently developed enough to have the responsibility, without parental involvement, to decide whether to obtain an abortion? Is it not a conflict to say juveniles should not be eligible for the death penalty because they are not morally developed enough, but at the same time say juveniles are morally developed enough to decide whether to obtain an abortion without involving their parents?"
notsarc,"You are the only one defending them now...the funny part it, planned parenthood had the stats as reasons why abortion should be legal (or is legal). But wait! As we established the number of people that died from abortions went down to under a thousand so this reason is still not accurate and is still misleading. Anymore ideas?"
notsarc,"Of course everyone has some basis for their views. Not even denying that. However there are ways that using that ""basis"" most certainly is an imposition and the gay rights battle is a prime example. There are many, many, many people who have done work to stop/block gay marriage and other gay rights when they, themselves, are not gay. That is not merely passing judgement - that is imposition. All I am asking here is that Archie, you, JP, etc. own that."
notsarc,"No. That's not what I said. I said that natural selection is differential reproductive success. I said that those organisms that possessed advantageous characteristics would tend to reach reproductive age more frequently and therefore they will tend to produce more offspring, while those with disadvantageous characteristics will tend to produce fewer offspring. As a result, the heritable characteristics of the population will change over time."
notsarc,"Almost?   Usually, that is true, and it involves selection between populations. However, there are often times when some of a population is better able to survive. Those times, selection occurs within a population."
notsarc,"You have some good points here, but what do you do in the event of pregnancy due to rape? Or a pregnancy that is going to put the life of the mother at risk?And to push the line a bit further, what about failed contraception, where the 'morning after' pill is taken? Does that count as abortion as it happens after conception?Smiley"
notsarc,"No, you are mistaken. Evolution is concerned with the change in allele frequency over time. The age of the Universe is irrelevent."
notsarc,"Religious faith, by definition, is a ""jump in the dark"" and there is really little(if any) common intellectual ground on which Creationism and ScientificMaterialism can meet. In principle, given adequate evidence etc., there isnothing in the material world that cannot be explained by Science. Butsomeone who has, so to speak, already jumped into the dark cannot see this.The most interesting questions that a supernatural account of human life can raise are concerned with the evolution of law, morality, social conventions,aesthetic sensibility and such like."
notsarc,But I think that Gods originally came about to explain why a large yellow thing goes up and down everyday. To a caveman the most logical explanation is there is a God. Now we know better. Just because there are still things we can't explain does not mean they must be from God.
notsarc,"Like blacks once were? Wasn't that the main thrust of the 14th amendment and incorporation? Given incorporation, imagine the suits those acts of discrimination would bring emoticonXGood "
notsarc,"Well then this doesn't answer my question.If you have 10 doctors for 100 people (this is just an example) and only 50 of them have health insurance and each doctor gets paid $100 a year then your health care per capita is $10 ([10doctors x $100]/100 people). If you change it to 100 people with health insurance you now have $10 per capita as well because you population did not change. Health care costs are shown per capita and not per person insured: Per Capita Health Expenditures by Country, 2007 &mdash; Infoplease.comSo again, if you go from $6,000 per capita per that website given above to say Switzerland levels at $4,100 per capita then where did that money come from?"
notsarc,"Apparently this is a petition opposing the pending resolution before the Illinois lawmakers that will deprive the rights given in the Constitutions. It is to encourage the lawmakers to vote against it. The lawmakers have not yet agreed to vote it down. Knowing the State of Illinois, I am predicting they will pay no attention to the commoners.   The only thing a glean out of this is that the common people have more sense than the lawmakers. But I've actually known that for a long time."
notsarc,"Well memory is NOT something that is immaterial is it. Its always implemented in the form of material processes well known to biochemistry. Metabolism, ion flows, neuron activity and interconnections, along with potentiation of those connections into networks.Free-will of course is what we call the experience of our choices being not wholly determined by external states alone. By no means does that exclude the fact that our internal states (of which we are largely ignorant) also play a role. The autonomy arises from the operation of the brain and those internal states. Again a purely materialist explanation. And there is no evidence of anything other than material processes in the experience of free-will. In other words neither memory nor free-will require a non-materialist viewpoint."
notsarc,"So you've gone from evolution and ID to cosmology. You have a real problem with maintaining established realms. ID addresses evolutionary theory, not abiogenesis, and not cosmology."
notsarc,"Being new isn't a problem. Nor is uncertainty about a position. The way to learn is to ask questions in appropriate places. However, a problem with message boards is that, without experience, it may be difficult to tell who is speaking from knowledge and who is speaking from ignorance or faith."
notsarc,"There is just one thing however. The coelacanths found are different from those in the fossil record. Further, ALL evidence pointed to them being extinct, until we found other evidence, and we changed it. And, to top it off, the article says NEARLY extinct, not COMPLETELY. Although, this article was of course written after the coelocanths were re-discovered. Of course, this has absolutely nothing to do with the theory of evolution, which explains the mechanisms responsible for the change of allele frequencies in populations over time."
notsarc,"The whole ""change the definition of marriage"" is mainly a scare tactic used by anti-gay religious bigots. They don't seem to realize that words can have several meanings."
notsarc,"So? In your religion's view, everyone sins. Their sin is no greater or more unforgiveable than yours."
notsarc,This also applies to tapeworms. I fail to see how it is therefore relevent to any debate on abortion.
notsarc,Manslaughter involves a direct action that causes an unintentional death. Miscarriage is involuntary; besides the person suffering a miscarriage might well want to keep the baby. To equate miscarriage with manslaughter is preposterous.
notsarc,"The interesting thing about the 'quality of life ethic' is that, in a pro-choice framework, it means that we can't degrade anyone's quality of life without their permission. So far from entailing a cull of the elderly, the infirm, the handicapped, and the ugly, the quality of life ethic entails that we cannot kill them off. Each person is entitled to the quality of life that they desire where what they desire does not infringe on other's quality of life. "
notsarc,"So the initial murder wasn't enough to show ""that they are willing to commit acts of violence""? This makes absolutely no sense."
notsarc,The anti-abortionists claim that would be killing a human life to save one.
notsarc,"No it doesn't, as abortion WAS a legal option in this case.   This was not a legality issue, but an education issue."
notsarc,All of the points above should be considered if you want to produce a solid argument that a series of events actually occured in the past. If you wish others to take this seriously please produce some relevant evidence from a source that held to a higher level of credibility. By your standards I should make a thread based on the National Enquirer or Star about Kerry's life as a male gigolo or golddigger.
notsarc,"If that were true, why are there millions of miscarriages each year? I don't believe a word of it."
notsarc,And we all know that is what it will become. I'm willing to bet money that Marc is going to argue that abiogenesis is a part of evolution as well as the big bang. There's a clear reason why he won't accept the definitions before the debate starts.
notsarc,The problem here is that Christians (such as I am) consider the Bible to be Proof.
notsarc,"I'm not trying to prove anything. I'm asking if you'd think differently in that case, and you're not answering."
notsarc,Clinton gave access to b/c which is known to prevent pregnancies. Bush has reduced access to b/c (including e/c). A primary reason for aborting is money - Americans have been less well off under Bush.
notsarc,"You/he could just have said 'slippery slope' in the first place; that argument is an old one, which I though was dealt with a long time ago. You can't disapprove of A on the grounds that it might lead to B - firstly because you have little to no evidence that it will, secondly because A is not necessary for B to happen and thirdly because that difference between A and B is all the argument you need to prevent B but be in favour of A. You can approve of punishing criminals but be against the death sentance."
notsarc,"First of all, the government cannot increase the volume and social acceptance of a drug - only the market and society can do that. Government cannot even decrease the volume or social acceptance of drugs - despite the government's efforts, drug use has remained relatively constant. What hasn't remained constant is violent crime, which has gone up during the drug war as it did during alcohol prohibition."
notsarc,These aren't the only two options available. The many philosophical views of the material world or ethics don't mean these two things don't exist.
notsarc,"Yet it is the only source I've seen that counted the incedents in which a gun was used in self-defence, but nobody was injured. I could assume that all of your sources and Ians only count occasions where one was injured. According to the source, they'd 91.7% of all times where a gun was used in self-defence."
notsarc,"He's pointing out that the situation is about the mother and the baby, and that the baby's right to life ends exactly where the woman's right to personal autonomy begins. That's the interesting thing about rights-based ethics, that the rights of any individual are limited precisely by the rights of all other individuals."
notsarc,I think that scientists don't work with religion and religion has no place in science class.
notsarc,"When the criminal has greater civil protections than his victim, and this is viewed as being civilized, a society is doomed."
notsarc,"Well let's put it this way. I really like playing baseball. So I put in a law that says everyone has to play baseball unless they're in a position where it will threaten their life. Since it's such a wonderful thing no one should have any problem with a law passed, right?"
notsarc,I think you are entirely correct. From the page VOR linked:
notsarc,"So, if there was a way to know that that baby would be infertile it would be alright in your view to abort?"
notsarc,"Not entirely true. While we can't disprove that God created the universe, we can disprove many creationist claims. For example, we can disprove that the earth is 6000 years old."
notsarc,"And it is. The ToE is a theory, however. It explains evolution, which has been observed. Do not attempt to deny that."
notsarc,"No one wants to take your ""marriage"" away Matt. It's a free country--no one's going to block your way to any chapel that will marry you. Do your gay thing. But let marriage be marriage--it's a different matter. People just want to keep you from tampering with the institution of marriage."
notsarc,"See Above.I can't help but notice your signature. What are you, Patriot under a different username? Bad show, Patriot. Sock Puppets aren't good debate form.Patriot-- About your statement that you've been vindicated. I hope you're just fooling around. :)TruthSeeker's first post doesn't even belong in a debate forum. She stated an opinion, and then stated absolutely nothing to back it up in any way. No evidence. No reasoning. Not one ""because"". Nothing. It was like entering a presidential candidate debate and saying, ""I think the other guy sucks"" and leaving. Hence why I asked her as politely as possible to elaborate."
notsarc,When the needs of the two are in conflict this is unavoidable.
notsarc,"Actually, I don't remember that they did. What they did take bets on was that AIG would be able to find enough stupid people who would buy into their ignorant and scientifically illiterate tripe. As I recall, most who were actually aware of how stupid creationists can be bet that they would be able to do so. So now, besides their other so called 'peer reviewed' magazine, they want to pretend that they are doing science here."
notsarc,"Exactly, which brings us back to square 1. Creationism is based on religion, and Evolution is based on the Scientific method, but is not proven. Creationism isnt even near being proven. So, why would you try to impose your religious beliefs on public school children?"
notsarc,"just isn't the case in countries with nationalised health care, yet those countries also have a large number of pharmaceutical companies that are based there."
notsarc,Yet another application of a different meaning of the word in an effort to group everything in science that you don't understand and won't accept under one word.
notsarc,"Again, modern birds seem to do fine as do gliding mammals such as flying squirrels."
notsarc,"Too much spin there buddy. The potentiality arguement is used by those who believe women have a right to have control over their fertility. As an aside it is also a fundemental tenent in Judaism's view of the unborn- the foetus is a potential life, but has not yet attained that state of being, which occurs at birth."
notsarc,And you think this a good thing? It just shows the weak cowardly position of the creationist.
notsarc,"No, there isn't a consensus among Christians, at least not beyond the fact that God was responsible in one way or another for the universe existing. There is no consensus about method."
notsarc,Do you see the other cities pushing for outrageous standards like NYC?
notsarc,"Now this is a totally inaccurate generalization.I don't think you actually realize the sheer numbers of people who smoke pot in this country, and I'm talking on a regular basis.I am certainly one of them. I have friends that do it and friends that don't.We all lead your typical normal life."
notsarc,"If DOMA isn't declared unconstitutional, then those arguing against Prop 8 are micturating into the wind."
notsarc,"The original molecule had some lipolytic function, but removing some amino acids from it, in the right place, made it fit better into the substrate, and thereby greatly increased its functionality. Barbarian observes:We thought it would take roughly a million years for bacteria to evolve enzymes capable of digesting nylon (because the compound is so different than any they were able to digest) but it took less than a century. ."
notsarc,"A law baning same-sex marriage, then I'd agree. But the reason same-sex marriage doesn't exist (other than Mass.) is not because of law; after all, there are plenty of states that don't have same-sex marriage with no law that outlaws it. You're barking up the wrong tree--this is a cultural issue more than a legal one."
notsarc,"Well, actually society has said that 18 is the dividing line. It can then also say, that under certain circumstances, for a particularly bad person, in some cases it will be considered if the person is 16 or 17. That's why we have all the judges and lawyers, etc..."
notsarc,"Stevens said that bear arms has a military meaning. So was he saying that the right is individual but existed in connection with militia service? Is this some kind of hybrid model? Interestingly, scholars who made similar claims in the past got lumped in with those who supported a collective right by the pro gun crowd. But I suppose it sounds good to say that all nine Supreme Court justices supported an individual rights interpretation. "
notsarc,"And the risk to minority's civil rights is, of course, the reason for the bill. They are, after all, limiting what can be started via initiative, not eliminating the initiative process altogether. The fraud was merely an example of why the change is needed. As has been argued here before, if civil rights need protecting, it's from the majority. Allowing civil rights to be modified via the initiative process simply makes it too easy for the majority to impose it's will on the minority. That's not what a Democracy is about, at least not our Democracy."
notsarc,"That's not true -- actually, it doesn't make sense. Science is just a bunch of rules (by definition). ""Biology uses science to study life"" is true. ""Physics uses science to study the physical world"" is true, but ""science's purpose is to study life"" is not true. "
notsarc,"Actually, I am of the opinion that the fetus has no natural rights of its own. Any rights we grant to a person as a citizen or national are granted at the moment of birth. By granting equal rights to a 3week old fetus that you do to a 20 year old man, you are endangering the rights of the woman who carries that child. Yes, I believe that in most circumstances, the child should be carried to term, but there are exceptions to every rule, and I'm not quite ready to forsake the lives and health of women to protect unborn children. Yes, I think the unborn child is worthy of protection, but not any more so than the mother, in fact probably less."
notsarc,"Ah ha! Someone who understands the application of information theory to biological organisms. By the biological specific definition of information, the genome of any organism is information about the environment in which it lives."
notsarc,It stops us from saying we ara a rational people. I don't support any laws that would allow a father not to have a say so about his child being aborted. Are there any?? If it were a life or death thing for the mother no question.As I stated I don't like the idea but making it illegal would simply put more unwanted kids in state homes. Lets take care of the living first!
notsarc,"But himps living in the jungle were in competition with other himps which didn't migrate to the plains. And pressures from predators, climate and changes in the ecosystem should have continued to force the need or desire to control their environment as our line of himp grew to do. My point is that with all of the same basic tools to start out with such as fingers, opposable thumbs and walking upright, there is no reason why only our line evolved to the level that human beings have attained with the same hundreds of millions of years, and the same pressures pushing us all forward, or towards extinction."
notsarc,It's not a literal account unless you interpret it that way.
notsarc,Since they are issued by the military I would think so. 
notsarc,"Let's not confuse our readers. supersport is not saying it's evolution; he's saying that ""evolutionists"" say that it's evolution. It should be clear now to the readers that scientists recognized perfectly well that this is an example of plasticity."
notsarc,"That's an interesting subject, I had not heard of that b4. Did our bodies once produce Vitamin C?."
notsarc,Actually all decisions based on the self ARE selfish decisions. I really don't care. I make them all the time too. Everyone does. While this is a philosophical issue I really see it as odd that people claim not to be selfish when doing something that benefits them or prevents harm to them with little regard to anyone else.
notsarc,"I believe it's there, but I'm certainly no one to push that belief on anyone."
notsarc,"Sigma I have taken into account the options a woman has after pregnancy. However, there are no doubt cases in the history of the world (not just within America) where there were no options available to a mother but to keep her child (ie: the first human woman to give birth in the history of the world). For this pro-choice line of reasoning to be absoulutely true it must be true in every possible situation. Are you saying that the killing would be justified if no other options were available to her?"
notsarc,"I guess I'd have to reluctantly admit that it didn't take long for some....but I'm an eternal optimist and think civility will prevail. Besides, I try not to judge everybody by the acts of a few."
notsarc,"You can do whatever you want to do with your money. The fact that you don't know any better than to do that with your money is telling, though. If you think that the C(R)SC actually does ID-based scientific research, you're exactly the dupe they're looking for.I'm serious. Do the research for yourself. I won't even give you links, because you'll XXXX them off as propaganda. Find any scientific journal article written by a DI member that's actually based on actual scientific experimentation or investigation and supports ID. I dare you."
notsarc,Do you think that the woman will not relive the rape on a daily basis if she destroys the child? Not likely. I think she will still suffer through those thoughts. Killing the baby complicates this. What happens if she has horrible thoughts about a rape with more thoughts about the abortion?
notsarc,"I think they are doing it out of fear. They see the moral decline in America and they have latched onto the GLBT Community as their scapegoat. Since it's no longer PC To attack African-Americans for their obvious differences, it's not PC to go after other religions (especially Judaism - not that it actually stops pure hate groups from doing it) they have decided that attacking a group of people which are sexually different should be the way to go.I mean, their religion tells them that premarital sex is bad and wrong. Even though there is a multi-billion dollar industry based around HETEROSEXUAL sex, they actually depend on that money too much to bite the hand that feeds them. Insted, they attack a group that has not legal rights to marriage let alone little legal standing as far as individual rights. It's easier that way."
notsarc,"Evolution's evidence is that life is similar, you won't be able to find an exception I am sure."
notsarc,"So, because she's bigger, she can kill the fetus off? That is generally the idea the school yard bully has."
notsarc,There's a distinct difference... so what? No baby at any age can live outside the womb. It still needs care and attention like any other. This difference in age doesn't mean anything.
notsarc,"that is not true. a levitating guru that has been seen and proven to levitate doesnt make the process natural. an alien that has been seen and proven to teleport and abduct people in their retractor beam doesnt make the process less paranormal. the definition of supernatural/paranormal doesnt automatically mean they can never be observed, just that they defy physical law. the definition of God is a special case that includes never being observed/proven"
notsarc,"So everyone thinks that ""evolutionists"" should seize power or something? If that is true, it is because evolution is very widely accepted."
notsarc,"They can ""marry"" whomever they love. Benefits though, are a different matter. The state and society views marriage as an opposite-sex institution. It's not about anyone getting harmed; no one said it was."
notsarc,That and VOR keeps flip flopping on his positions and he refuses to clarify his contridictions.
notsarc,"You believe two things that are incorrect: that you have refuted evolutionary theory, and that we will now accept intellegent design because of your attempt."
notsarc,"How do you know there isn't a tiger in the bathroom? You feel very strongly and have over-whelming evidence that there is no tiger in your bathroom? (You live in an urban area, there are no zoos, you don't hear scratching or biting or the maiming of your poodle, and the water is going) But you cannot prove a negative. Which is also why you won't be able to prove that creationism is wrong, and why we can't prove evolution is wrong. The focus must be on proving one right. How you might do that depends on your method of reasoning and thought."
notsarc,"If putting the child up for adoption, this can be covered too. However, you havingto take time out per doctors instructions is something you might not desire as it could affect career opprotunities in certain lines of work."

notsarc,"There's no adding of firearms going on, because they're already there! The criminals have them, that's a hard fact of life that can't ever be changed. Deal with it. What we want is for the intended victims to be on equal footing with the bad guys. There's nothing unreasonable about that."
notsarc,"Cars are a privilege, your gun isn't. Show me evidence that would support the registration of your first amendment rights being constitutional."
notsarc,"I laughed when I first saw the ad on MSNBC's Hardball tonight. It shows the fear, insecurities and the fallacies that guide anti-gay equality rights activists."
notsarc,"Sorry to inform you, but until you are 18 years old in this country, you are not granted full protection of your rights under the constitution of the united states. I don't agree with testing either, but saying that it violates your rights is not a valid argument. "
notsarc,"Actually, it is. There are multitudes of known characteristics that have been shown to be the result of a single point difference in the gene. The discovery of regulatory functions of some translated segments of DNA does not in any way discount what is known about gene function."
notsarc,"it is no ""story""........i am debating on the whole evolution thing... look at the facts. so many great ppl, physics people, niels bohr, he was for evoulution, then he found out all of the facts that it is junk, so he became a christian"
notsarc,"We're legally dead when we no longer mentally exist (hence the term ""brain-dead""), so there is no logical reason to set the beginning point as anything other than the start of the mental existence. Just as people who are dead and without mental existence do not have the ability to obtain rights, a collection of human cells without a mental existence cannot obtain rights. I also notice you have resorted to attacking other people's views rather than following the topic of the thread, which is to share YOUR views. emoticonXBanghead"
notsarc,"This whole riff where people talk about preventing employers from firing gays JUST cause they are gay as a ""special right"" is something that seems to fool those who are prejudiced against gays...... but for most people, they recognize it as a propagandic phrasing with little merit.I think our laws should include something that prevents people from firing employees based on the employee's sexual orientation.But to utilize your phrasing Archie, do you think that religion is something that deserves ""special rights""?"
notsarc,"""Healthy Families"" seems like a strange name for this group that the link is to."
notsarc,"actually, it can be proven whether leprechauns, unicorns, the flying spaghetti monster, magical space monkeys and livining care baers, and even god, exists or not.the question of proving a belief seems kinda self-contradictory to me. if something is a fact that can be proven, then your belief about it is irrelevant. likewise, if you believe something, whether there are facts to support it or not, its still your belief. there are people who believe things inn the absence of supporting facts, and sometimes even in the face of opposing facts. the term for that is faithfaith is the belief of something in the absence of evidence. if you have faith in something, proof is irrelevant, or at least it should be"
notsarc,"But you know what really doesn't make sense? Why are they evangelising to people (who they know most of them will reject them) if those people get a special dispensation? They'd be condemning people to hell by evangelizing, would they not? Why not leave the people be and let them get the special dispensation? emoticonXConfused"
notsarc,"That is not quite what the 'mitochondrial Eve' hypothesis posits.Science. 1995 Dec 22;270(5244):1930-6. The myth of Eve: molecular biology and human origins.Ayala FJ.University of California, Irvine, USA.It has been proposed that modern humans descended from a single woman, the ""mitochondrial Eve"" who lived in Africa 100,000 to 200,000 years ago. The human immune system DRB1 genes are extremely polymorphic, with gene lineages that coalesce into an ancestor who lived around 60 million years ago, a time before the divergence of the apes from the Old World monkeys. The theory of gene coalescence suggests that, throughout the last 60 million years, human ancestral populations had an effective size of 100,000 individuals or greater. Molecular evolution data favor the African origin of modern humans, but the weight of the evidence is against a population bottleneck before their emergence. The mitochondrial Eve hypothesis emanates from a confusion between gene genealogies and individual genealogies."
notsarc,I see no reason why secular shows should be required to mention your mythology.
notsarc,"Because if you let gays marry because it is an alternitve way the equal protection says that if you let one happen you have to let the others have that right to. But that is not really my point my real point is that if we let this happend it will ruin marriage in this country, marriage is a bond between a man and a women and if we let gays marry this country will be ruining that tradition thus making this country more secular then it all ready is. AND WE HAVE TO STOP THAT."
notsarc,"I believe the question was ""who?""I'm christian and I believe in evolution. Whether it contradicts the Old Testament or not makes no difference to me. Jesus contradicted the Old Testament.The Bible is the inspired word of God, not a dictation to scribes. Men wrote the allegories describing the creation of things.Saying that mankind took a long time to understand certain things is not limiting the power of God. He could have chosen to make early man Einsteinian, but He didn't. He could have chosen for mankind to bypass the flat-earth concept, but He didn't. He could have chosen for all humans to be highly intelligent, but He didn't. What He did was to leave us alone and let us figure things out on our own, including how long it took to get where we are now."
notsarc,"In what universe is there a right to murder?Unfortunately, we in the United States have only recently recognized that abusing children and owning slaves is not a right.And, only recently have women enjoyed the right to vote in the United States.What certain activities are forbidden in public?Some of the conservative red states have only recently decreed that there should be speek limits. Not for safety reasons, of course.And, George Walker Bush has guaranteed the right of corporations to dump dangerous chemicals into lakes and rivers and the oceans."
notsarc,"Well you don't need to doubt it. I like to be rational but I also wish to believe in God. I need some evidence, any evidence, to believe in God and that would be all I would need."
notsarc,They are: those that survive better reproduce more. Members of a species can die if other members have better food/light/attention/camaflouge.
notsarc,See above. Give kids credit. You give them a bogus answer and they will know. We have got to stop treating sex like a dirty little secret.
notsarc,"And if we can actually doing anything about it. From what I hear on the fringes, the debate should not be about how to change or stop it, but how to change to deal with it and what we should expect as society adapts to a change in climate."
notsarc,"It can't come up with evidence if it's suppressed from future generations. Until you can show that happenstance origins are science, you have no basis to declare that intelligent design is not science. I agree that I haven't shown how ID has a potential advantage to the political corruptness of today's scientific community, but I've shown it's potential advantage to our society. I've shown how thinking is involved with it, the type of thinking involved in any school class involving philosophy, which you said science classes should have."
notsarc,"I think you misunderstand my view. I think that a third-term fetus is already sufficiently a person, so I would CERTAINLY consider a newborn baby a person. To me, a person is one who has the most basic, rudimentary sense of thought and emotion. A late-term fetus, from my point of view, is no less a person than an Einstein. An Einstein, of course, is much more useful to a much greater number of people, but from the simple point of view of whether he is more of a person, I would say not."
notsarc,"Well this involves the free will / determinism debate, you say you aren't free if your preferences are implanted... I say you are free when you act in accordance with your preferences, regardless of how those preferences were arrived at. I think to claim you need to ""choose"" your preferences is absurd, as the act of choosing requires prior preferences, which presumably also required a choice.... and the question of how we acquired our first preference arises..."
notsarc,"That's the thing, though; even a self-professed non-expert can perfectly well refute the ridiculous points supersport continually spouts. supersport, on the other hand, doesn't know any better."
notsarc,The fact that it's the truth is why I keep repeating it.
notsarc,Sorry to shatter you little world but this is happening it has been happening 25 years and it is happening now and it is completly legal no laws have been broken and yes there is a market for fetal tissue /limbs and bodies.Do some research you will be surprised what you will find.
notsarc,"Mythology. But nevertheless, shipbuilding has been going on for a lot longer than 500 years. There have been a lot of skilled shipbuilders who have passed along their knowledge from generation to generation. Do you think that every time someone builds a ship that they invent the whole process? Nah. 300 ft is about the limit for wood no matter how you design it. Even worse it you cast a big box adrift in a huge storm. How did the animals survive the rolling and rolling?"
notsarc,"Somehow I don't think a high percentage of Ham's ""facts"" are facts."
notsarc,"I'm afraid it is you who is wrong. I created you so that you would think you created me to think I created everything, even though I did. It's more of a challenge that way to try to convert people to the one true religion. Since you can see that I won't be able to convert the world (it's due in a week), you can pay $100 dollars to me so I will take you with me to the upper world."
notsarc,"Yes, everyone is a ""potential"" felon. Fortunately most people never commit a felony. And there are many different types of weapons, all which could be used by previously law abiding citizens to commit an act of violence."
notsarc,"Because some restrictions that might pass constitutional muster, don't amount to an outright ban. How would impossibility ever be considered constitutional?"
notsarc,"Since when does the fate get decided by the victim? A woman could be said to have a biased opinion on it because she is an involved party. Even so, I take the stand that no one has any authority over the other to make that decision."
notsarc,The short answer is that it isn't. See the details here: Phil Plait
notsarc,"Yes. The assumption happens to be that maybe the bible isn't literal. ""Lets look into ourselves, shall we?"" Behold we did, and Lo! The Earth is old!"
notsarc,"No. It steps firmly in the realm of REALITY Jyoshu.Have you never heard people talk about how police in an area respond in X amount of time for one situation, but for a different situation, like in a neighborhood predominantly black or gay or ___, the response time is four times as long?Have you never heard of how there have been cases where people have died because they tried to get medical help at the ""white"" hospital?Or how about you read about THIS case and tell me that these concerns aren't real..."
notsarc,"No, but the Roman persecution of Christians, covering Christians in pitch, Roman garden parties, witnesses for Christ being killed for their faith etc. is as irrelevant as it gets. Just be careful, that's all I'm saying. There is a place for that topic."
notsarc,Again? What do you mean? I am talking about different sciences per se. What is your question?
notsarc,"Sounds like the same skeptic argument above. I don't know about you Nu Leader, but when I'm certain my mind exists. Are you not certain? You are actually required to be, to deny you exist would require existence, and that would be logically contradictory."
notsarc,The criminals in DC already have their guns. All striking down DC's handgun ban will do is let the law abiding be able to better defend themselves and be armed for a change.
notsarc,"Oh, undoubtedly - but the offspring aren't inheriting traits as such are they? They're just suffering the same symptoms of malnutrition as their parents, except that for them it's happening in vitro so they exhibit the effects from birth. That's why it's such a bad example for what you're trying to get others to accept."
notsarc,"But the embryo is a mere clump of flesh inside of a woman's body. Science proves it. It has no sign of intelligence, it is merely cells at this stage. Therefore, it cannot be referred to as another person, or neighbor, and is no where near comparable to a human. Choices that harm another should be illegal, but choices regarding your own personal liberty and freedom should be made by the individual. Not the government."
notsarc,"So why should you care about their non-scientific beliefs in a debate on science? Most people who believe in evolution do so because of science, so their non-scientific beliefs are irrelevant."
notsarc,"And, what percentage is that? How was the poll conducted? Who conducted it? How was the determination made about who was a 'scientist'?"
notsarc,That is true but that is the procedure.........Do you deny it?
notsarc,"But the whole process was done in the courts using the process set up by the constitution. Where the laws are not clear on an issue, such as in Massachusetts, it is the courts job to decide. The courts are a check on the injustice towards minorities by the majority."
notsarc,I believe I said I would change my view. I will change my view on the issue of whether homosexuality is genetic.
notsarc,"Please note that I added the word ""human"" to your comment above IANGB. After all it is not my claim that all zygotes are human beings / ""persons."" Agree? Also, I want to make it clear that I am arguing only for the most basic of human rights (life) and not for the full panopoly of rights that say an adult human individual would have."
notsarc,I believe that science explains the way God created the universe.
notsarc,Just because a man pays support doesn't mean he is part of the childs life.He has no obligation to do *fatherly* things with his child.Women pay child support BTW.
notsarc,"That was a nice rant that had absolutely nothing to do with anything. The essential question is not what various religous leaders have said about the issue, but what the Bible says about the issue."
notsarc,"First of all, it's not a precedent. this is the seventh or eighth state where a higher court has found anti-gay discrimination in marriage unconstitutional. Secondly, when so many rulings go in this direction, it can hardly be called ""lawlessness"". It's a call for lawful, constitutional interpretation of statutes.It takes extraordinary intellectual dishonesty to pretend there is some ""agenda"" at work. These decisions are the consequence of two things: our long history of rationally applying those silly words about equality that folks smarter than this generation of politicians put in the Constitution AND a long-term correction of the misunderstandings of what homosexuality IS and what its consequences are.I know you don't personally believe it, but there is nothing wrong with us."
notsarc,You got it. People make mistakes. Finally you see that scientists are just as human as religious people.
notsarc,O they don't make space anymore. They'll just put him in a cell with pot growers and crack addicts. He'll be lucky if he gets a spot on the floor to sleep on.
notsarc,no base for calling it a human being? Other than the fact that a fetus is scientifical a human being. Seems you have no basis for saying I can't call a fetus a human being.
notsarc,What you quoted is what Answers in Genesis said. Please do not be dishonest and tell others that I said this as I did not.
notsarc,"This is simply false. Rock can be folded under pressure. This has been proven by lab experiment. However there are many features in sedimentary rocks that cannot be formed quickly, for example, fossil trackways."
notsarc,"The argument that the baby is not a parasite, but is rather 'in its natural environment' seems a false dichotomy: it is natural for a parasite to be in the enviroment of another's body, invading it. The relationship element will be dealt with in the third section."
notsarc,"Well, yeah, if science hasn't provided an explanation for a phenomenon, then all we can do is shrug and submit grant proposals."
notsarc,"Well, that's your claim, anyway. Truth is that billions of theists accept evolutionary theory as is and reject the standard ID arguments."
notsarc,"But wouldn't the biochemical similarities speak for themselves? That is, does one have to believe that the two specimens (which share biochemical similarities) evolved in order to infer that they will respond similarly to antibiotics? The observable facts of the similarities would seem sufficient (and more scientific?)."
notsarc,"And for the record, i think anyone that tries to take away a women's right to her own body is a sexist and has no respect for human life, or has any concious about the woman at stake here. You care merely about a couple of cells and not about the real humans, nor do you care about society. It seems to me you are only trying to earn yourself brownie points in heavan. I am not influenced by that, im going to have my own opinions, and speak about what i feel is right instead of some christian god telling me what to do."
notsarc,If you can't eliminate demand you could try to limit supply and control access to that supply.
notsarc,Why would they be useless? They aren't useless on birds? And how is this qustion different in any meaningful way from the above? Aren't wings forelimbs with feathers? It seems that soaring or gliding or even faster running would be extremely useful.
notsarc,"He made a post suggesting you were a troll, it has been removed it seems. Anyway, glad to help."
notsarc,"Well let's deal with one thing at a time. The NEJM study about Washington D.C. concluded that banning handguns saved 47 lives each year. The study didn't conclude that it was just a ""curious relationship in the numbers."" Go back to that thread and read the study. If you're looking for evidence that is absolutely without any degree of uncertainty then you won't find it. You can't prove things to a 100% certainty with statistics. What you can do is show what is probably true and what is probably not true. Even in court you're not expected to prove that someone is guilty to a 100% certainty. You're expected to prove that they are guilty beyond a reasonable doubt."
notsarc,"Erm... we are? Levels of CO2 in the atmosphere are usually quoted as parts per million, currently a little over 380ppm, 150 years ago closer to 280. In 1970 about 330ppm.   Carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"
notsarc,"That would most likely (imo) reduce the number of abortions performed. It would depend, I think, on how viable it is to transfer the embryo into the artificial womb. Forced surgery would not be an option if I had anything to do about it."
notsarc,"Really? A human can be determined scientifically. Personhood is a human legal construct. You cannot prove scientifically what a ""person"" is."
notsarc,"I wouldn't say most cjurches, because you cannot prove that. There is a long list of churches that are accepting of gay folks."
notsarc,"In the examples you gave, the doctor is clearly trying his* very best to save the most lives he can. What if the Siamese twins were in no mortal danger while together? And what if one Siamese twin has legs but the other doesn't? Isn't the other twin dependent on the one with legs? Could a doctor ethically remove the legless twin if the legged twin wanted to and if the legless twin was retarded and the procedure would leave the legless twin dead?*(or her best.. I'm sorry but my doctor is male, so I will no longer use ""his/her"" or ""he/she""... it just gets tiring after a while...)"
notsarc,"A slimey claim you cannot support as usual. In developed Nations, the U.S. is far down the list as has been posted on this very board at least 5 times. Those 'other' Nations also have far more crime and violent crime than the U.S."
notsarc,Not sure how you can tell that since very little is mentioned about his methods.
notsarc,"I did not say that evolution precludes God, all I am saying is that many Atheists seem to think it does, and thus it likely contributes to the number of people who beleive there is no God. If a person does not beleive in God, then they must beleive there is no ultimate morality."
notsarc,"732,000 DIDN'T sign the petition. It seems only 5% of South Dakotans say ""repeal the extreme abortion ban"" and that is ASSUMING that all the signatures are valid. The good news for South Dakota is that come November they can show America how they really feel about abortion as opposed to having the courts decide laws."
notsarc,"jessica, all these problems you've listed, the human body takes care of automatically and remarkably well. the fact still remains that only less than 5% of all abortions occur because the risk is great enough to be deemed life-threatening to either tha mother or the child. and that percentage is diminishing as well. the overwhelming majority of abortions occur simply because the woman decides she does not wnat to be a mother."
notsarc,Well he HAS admitted he can't prove his belief. I guess that posting here would admit his false dichotomies that it's either literal genesis or evolution are false and god knows the world will end when that happens. Super admitting he's wrong? Never going to happen.
notsarc,"DC has a law that human and civil rights can not be put up for a vote, this is the way it should be in the rest of the country. Why do you want to be able to vote on other peoples lives? Why is it that you are so cruel?"
notsarc,"And yet quantum physics tends to be very contradictory, at least to our perceptions. Acausal events happen. A particle can be in two places at the same time. A particle can disappear and reappear in a different location without traversing that distance. And et cetera.Since the beginning of our local universe occurred at quantum levels, I would be cautious about drawing philosophical conclusions based on our macro-world experiences."
notsarc,"You can do so, and if I don't check your source I guess I'm SOL, eh? I've seen the story many places, but this is beyond simply a site dedicated to outing Bush since its a radio show :P"
notsarc,Of course the bolshevik revolution was doomed from the start as Russia was not indsutrialised and the revolution was imposed by a minority of the bourgeoisie rather than a mass movement of the proletariat (not that there was a proletariat in Russia at the time).
notsarc,The goal of anti-abortionist is clear. The job of self restraint is that of each participant in their close encounters.
notsarc,"Just like no one is really ""for"" abortions, but they think that it's the woman's right to decide. Maybe that's like when congress gave the President the right to decide to go to war, even when they were supposed to declare war."
notsarc,"The guy can have an opinion but the ultimate choice is up to the woman who can listen to what the guy says or not, it's up to her. I believe that is what sinjin was saying."
notsarc,"Ditto squared. If they support killing a perfectly healthy unborn child, they will argue that the reason stated in the Op is the main reason Abortion is needed and justified. And I must say that if 98% of all abortions were performed for that reason, the public stance against them might not be so strong."
notsarc,"Yes, it's very subjective. I was using evil as an example that was incorrectly used on the website. Even though evil is subjective, you can still be evil. (you can do evil to take away your goodness, but the only way to make yourself colder is by removing your heat, not adding ""cold"")"
notsarc,Then how exactly did a time capsule that was buried several feet underground get to the surface at the same rate as the surrounding area?
notsarc,"Yet without it the vessel is just worms, mud, then dust, like rock & tree houses, not made to endure, yet, the life force, energy, back to the cosmos/source, converted, capable of being rewinded, paused, and fastfowarded, like a movie screen amongst the stars, revealing our lives."
notsarc,It doesn't have to be that way because it's the death penalty. It's that way because of our ever deteriorating legal system.
notsarc,"Because of? Hardly. I feel it does change the morality of it, but it is not the sole criteria."
notsarc,"Exactly. Trying to prove that God, if he exists, didn't make us as good as an all powerful being should have made us doesn't prove anything in the God debate. I could always debate that since God is all powerful and all knowing he could have always thought of something better to do. If he made those changes, then of course there would still be something better he could have thought of. This would be an endless loop of creating something better and better until finally he would have to stop and say that is good enough. But even then this debate that he didn't make us as good as he could have would be valid in my view."

notsarc,"And right at the top of the list, at a whopping 31.2 per 100,000, is Washington DC, even though they had a complete and total gun ban in place. How the hell do you explain that? Nobody could own handguns, nobody could ever carry a gun, nobody could have a gun outside of their home, nobody could even load their private guns, so how do they get to be at the top of the list or death rates?"
notsarc,I think its actually the states job...the judiciary does need to overturn Roe v. Wade to get this done though...which doesn't mean it becomes illegal.
notsarc,"emoticonXWowYou are making up your own strawman arguments as you go along.Asking ""what they would need"" is a poor mask to avoid the fact that YOU HAVE NO EVIDENCE in the first place.A lot of ""doesn't this look like ..."", but that's akin to interpreting Rorschach tests. You see what you want to."
notsarc,"Just making sure that everybody is aware of his evasion, misrepresentation, and dishonesty. I figured a good time to do that would be while he was accusing scientists of these things... (I figure it's a damn good illustration when a paper's author tells him to stop misrepresenting the paper, and he keeps doing it anyway.)In fairness, being a creationist isn't necessarily an indicator of dishonesty; there are plenty of creationists who are creationists simply because they are uneducated about the subject. Unfortunately, supersport isn't part of this group; he has seen the evidence and is willfully ignorant of it."

notsarc,"There are several scientific explanations for the nature of the earth. Some use 'science' to say that the world is flat. Granted that these beliefs aren't widely accepted, but then not all religions are widely accepted. By your reasoning or 'logic' you must ask yourself about whether you should rely on science when there are many different scientific theories.The Flat Earth News, at least back then, had a regular column, ""One Hundred Proofs Earth is Not a Globe.""(go to http://www.flat-earth.org/)Other theories taught as sciencephrenologyalchemyevolutioneugenicsneptunismTheories of the Aether Articles relating to the Emergence of Scientific Theories of the Cosmic Aether(http://www.mountainman.com.au/aether.html)What about 'metascience'?http://www.calresco.org/lucas/science.htmOr, sciences used to support political ends...What about Marxist Sciencehttp://www.marxists.org/archive/hald...philosophy.htmor Chaos Theory and Marxismhttp://www.marxist.com/science/chaostheory.htmlThere's Nazi Sciencehttp://www.webster.edu/~woolflm/naziscience.htmlNationalist Sciencehttp://www.ljudmila.org/nettime/zkp4/08.htmOr social ends...Scientific Racismhttp://www.press.uillinois.edu/f02/tucker.htmlMainstream scientists instead of using the word 'heretic' use the word 'pseudo-science' to categorise fringe beliefs."
notsarc,Been saying that ever since the first time I heard about creationsism.

notsarc,"Actually, scientists who discard the global flood are taken seriously."
notsarc,"Is that a trick question? No, the tabloid and other gutter press keep going on about how bad it is, because they sell papers by fanning fear and hatred, and fear of crime is one of their biggest markets. Yes there has been an increase in gun crime over the years, but that's largely attributable to increased attractiveness of crime in a society where social mobility has come to a standstill. In any case the number of incidents where firearms are used in crime is still very small, which is why every time someone gets shot it is headline news.   Guns are incredibly rare in this country, the only time I've seen guns in real life (other than air rifles) is on a military base."

notsarc,"JFriday:In fairness, no one, pro or ant-gun can ever use UK stats to support thier argument again. Back in Jan '03 the UK government finally came clean and announced that they had been seriously fu**ing with crime statistics.You can make the argument that the UK state had something to hide with guncontrol and you would probably be right.

Religious freedom does not give you the freedom to deny freedom to someone else."

notsarc,"So gay people, in your opinion, have no right to form the families of their choice? So you are defending the continued oppression of gay people?We are sick of conservative family types. We are tired of the closet. The phrase ""we are mad as hell and we are not going to take it any more"" applies. I see in your response the comming of the camps to lock and exterminate gay people. It is that type of thought, that jews were subhuman, that led to the final solution. As it is here with conservatives and religious right nuts, who believe gay people are sub human sickos in need of curing or killing."
notsarc,"Well if there can be a Constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, why not to remove marrriage from the federal government? Where do they get that power Constitutionally? So that would mean states can choose not to recognize any marriage Constitutionally. I think that marriage is a church issue. Let gays, straights, everyone get civil unions to be recognized legally. But leave marriage to the churches."
notsarc,When you have no constructive comment just attacks the messenger with your insultsand name calling.....typical...............so very sad..........Its radicals like you that hurt the cause of gay rights.........
notsarc,I don't find it surprising. It's probably a strategic sacrifice on their part rather than a change in their personal views . They don't want to lose votes and possible support from gun owners for their priorities like health care reform because of a difference of opinion on gun control policy. They know that the Republicans are going to hit them with everything they've got during election time and exaggerated accusations about the Democrats wanting to take away people's guns would hurt them. The Republicans learned during the Clinton years that creating as much as paranoia as possible about the Democrats supporting big government is the way to regain a majority in Congress. It's all politics.

The book isn't written for non-humans, so when it says ""you"" we can assume it doesn't refer to non-humans. But the book never says ""animals don't have souls.""So we can't assume that they don't (according to the bible)."

notsarc,because that's the subject of this thread: what designing a solution to a problem actually entails.
notsarc,That's not quite right. More accurate would be: Nothing that occurs outside the realm of physical law is in the realm of science. Science by no means precludes the possibility of there being something outside the realm of science.
notsarc,"My mom can only trace her family back a few generations. By the time we get to the clan that lived in Ohio in the middle of the 19th century, the records get very confusing and very incomplete.

notsarc,"So what? That means in a firefight with police, the criminal will run out of ammunition in a matter of seconds and be ripe for the picking."
notsarc,"Actually, the more educated a person is, the less likely he is to be a creationist. Creationists tend to be semi-literate (poorly educated), rural, poor, and female."
notsarc,"But what about the hypothetical?I can't think of a single child on this planet that has never been exposed to the ideas of the supernatural.So, what I was asking is whether faith is nature or nurture.That's why I brought up kids being afraid of the dark, likely no matter what anyone tells them. I think it's this fear of the unknown linked to the ""logical"" brain of a human that possibly creates this need for explanations. But faith involves specifics, so when the specifics are filled in and ""make sense"" to more than one person, these specific ""explanations"" can be passed down.So I don't know how much of faith is nature and how much is nurture."
notsarc,Simple. The big government people will tell you that it's in everybody's best interest. The criminals will just kill you without debate.

notsarc,"No, it's often an emotional show. They choose their families based on submitted videos, usually from families with one or more physically challenged members, then they build them a house to fit their needs.There was one in particular with a blind autistic boy who loved to swing.

There was another about a deaf couple whose new home included and lot of strobe light signaling systems.BTW, alcohol is a depressant! emoticonXWow"
notsarc,I wish you could put your hands on that poll as well. Until then I'll remain skeptical. Let's remember that Democrats and liberals hunt. Remove that group and what's left? Something less than 20% of Americans that own only handguns.
notsarc,"Not in matters of atheism. Tell me, when science discovers something that seems to agree with the 150 year old writings of Darwin, are the writings of Darwin disregarded? Or is that type of history trumpeted to the masses?"
notsarc,I suppose the fact that Indian law only applies to its people. Who qualifies as an Indian is another matter. Many people who have as little as one-tenth Indian blood qualify for liberal hunting privileges here in Minnesota.
notsarc,Because there are no dinosaur fossils above the iridium layer.
notsarc,"Well it all depends on who is going to determine ""right"", isn't it? Abortion is not math. There are no finite answers. Just a myriad of opinions which inevitable lead to either abortion is right or abortion is wrong. No different now then when Roe v Wade became law or any other times in history. I do like Aristotle's take; He taught that a fetus originally had a vegetable soul but he didn't say what kind of vegetable."
notsarc,"How do you define evolution? If you don't see any, then you aren't using the definition used by evolutionary biologists. The question is who should define the vocabulary of evolutionary biologist, evolutionary biologists or creationists?"
notsarc,"Well, by the strict defintion of the word ""born"", an abortion is considered a premature birth."
notsarc,"Well, if they've re-established control in New Orleans(and it seems they have), then taking a gun away from someone carrying it on the street would be what the police normally do in any city. If they were taking it away from peoples' homes, and not letting them keep them, that would be over and above what they normally do. (I'm very pro-2nd Amendment, so don't get me wrong here. I'm just pointing out that taking guns away from people happens in every city every day)I also think that it's kind of disingenuous to complain about the military coming in--just a week ago everyone was criticizing the govt. for NOT sending in the military. Now people are criticizing them for doing it???"
notsarc,"Your reason for believing this lies entirely within the Bible. I hardly consider a 1500 year old book ""making clear what he wants"". Particularly given that even among those who believe the book, they still can't agree on what God wants. And of course, that doesn't even beging to address the issue of all the other holy books which contradict the Christian Bible. You may personally believe that you know what God wants, but if so it's not because God has been clear about it."

notsarc,"The problem with happenstance origins is that there is no evidence, and it's simply not possible to falsify it. If we were able to prove so many scientific proceedures (from abiogenesis to radiometric dating - all based on the presupposition that there is no God) were indisputably true, then ID would be falsified. There is not enough supporting evidence for happenstance origins. Yet so much of happenstance origins is considered science, so all too often, there is no line between religion and science. "

notsarc,"i'm impressed! this is a very precise description, in regular englishand yes, the deduction in 9 seems presumptious if all we state is God has a ""possibility of existence"". how this was cleverly cleared up (from the same source site) was simply a trip back to the definition: ""greatest possible being"". the ""greatest possible being"", by definition, MUST have a possible existence. in otherwords, we cannot assume that there is a possibility that the greatest possible being does not exist. yeah, it sounds like the whole ""proof"" is pointless because your premise is already the proofjust keep in mind that for the purposes of this proof, God is defined as ""the greatest being possible"". as long as that definition is maintained, the proof works...does that mean that God exists? hmmm....emoticonXFrazzled"
notsarc,"You know that what you call ""immoralism"" is my life. Why do you hate me so much that you would be willing to deny my the happiness that you take forgranted and as your due? You don't even know me yet you are willing to defame me just because I am different from you. I don't understand how I am running over you by living my life openly and wanting the same thing as you the right to consider whom I choose to be my family. If you have an opinion about gay rights thats fine. If you want to deny me the same rights, as you take for granted, because of your opinion and beliefs though laws then that is bigotry."
notsarc,"You're a little confused about that. It's all real DNA. Some of it just doesn't code for anything. But some parts of non-coding DNA (which you call ""junk"") has other functions besides coding for proteins."

notsarc,Look up the evolution of colour vision in primates. It's my personal favourite - but what do you think?
notsarc,"I think this is a fair conclusion. I went as far as I did because of what it seems to say about the governor calling for a joint session. I may be wrong, but the text seems to instruct the governor to keep them in joint session until final action is taken. In other words, it doesn't appear that the governor has an option. And it does not seem that the Constitution allows for a legislative session that never ends. I'm not sure how else to square the two except that the legislature should pursue final action. Of course, as you have pointed out, it really is hard to speculate on this one without any historical context of the amended Amendment Process, and/or the relevant legal precedent surrounding it. Any thoughts on this?"
notsarc,You yourself said you don't even know what the gun laws in California are. Yet you're saying there you believe they have legitimate tests?
notsarc,You think open carrying of loaded handguns in public will become fashionable in CA?   I think if anyone took to this they'd find themselves asked to leave establishments routinely.

notsarc,"but they do support the choice to abort a fetus or embryo. An argument made for slavery was that ""you don't have to own them but don't tell us what to do""..a fairly similar argument but doesn't show whether or not abortion is wrong just that some lines of thinking should be questioned."

sarc,"1868 actually, that is a link to the wikipedia article on the act. once again, the 14th amendment and the civil rights act of 1964 are not the same thing. more importantly, a store saying 'no blacks allowed' is not violating the 14th, they violate the civil rights act of 1964. furthermore, a store saying 'no guns allowed' is not violated the 2nd amendment.  time for you to read up on the constitution doc, you might find some good things in there. i'm a little surprised you don't vote democrat given your thoughts. then again, not much difference between a given democrat and your texas 'republicans' (see w bush and rick perry)"

sarc,i am very impressed with your ability to copy and paste links. now what this proves about what you know about it is still unproven. unless you are the one in the videos giving the lectures...and he looks like he has been studying this longer then 'almost a decade'. nice try though. what proof can you give that is pertinent to the debate about how that disproves an eternal being? also you may want to get with some of the other atheists on the site because they were pushing the eternal universe and big bounce theories as explanations in other debates. you all should get your scientific consensus on the same page.

sarc,"he can't sin, get a teenage girl knocked up on a one night stand, but not sin. slaughter innocents personally or command his followers to do so but can't sin. oh yes he isn't very good at watching out for his kids. i mean look at adam and eve and then he got another chance with jesus and look how that turned out. and see above for other things he can't do."
sarc,"there is no problem in what you 'believe' in. science is irrelevant in many beliefs. just sole belief in a deity and his disciples, is what many religions revolve around. but, i am astounded by your god's name, no harsh feelings. a dragon lord king is quite a mouth full don't you say? can we just call em, greeble. :)"
sarc,wow! i didn't know that. thanks! should i read the new york times instead?
sarc,"you really need to stop reading such biased, uninformed digital-age fishwrapper. i can think of at least one instance off the top of my head, justice alito's confirmation. the democrats threatened to filibuster bush's scotus choice. the gang of seven democrats agreed not to filibuster in return for the republicans not to use the 'nuclear option'. it was in all of the papers. i'm surprised that the leftwing rag missed it. emoticonxrolleyes"
sarc,oh yeah god is the root of all evil! tell that to the person who was about to murder their spouse for cheating but refrained from doing so because they believe that god is watching. how about that damn evil mother theresa too
sarc,"it looks like you have tried to analize everything i say as being 'my' life experiences. i really enjoy your abuse , i would love to meet up with you some day. my life is fantastic actually. i dont know why i have to keep repeating that. what about those in haiti right now ? what about others? i think they are more important than your fucking sulking over the americans lousy pronunciations.or me whining over you being an arsehole. as for amy winehouse , no reputable establishment would dare touch the skank."
sarc,"another attack from one who claims to be a loving christian. oh well, i'm not surprised."
sarc,"i must be blessed to be surrounded by so many posters with a direct line to god so that they know who is saved or in hell. with christians as well-informed as this, i'm surprised god doesn't just retire and let them take over. after all, 6,000 years since creation must be enough for anyone."
sarc,"look. it responded again. i swear, it just gets funnier. look at how far he's managed to fool himself: ' you are pissed at me for simply speaking the undeniable truth. does the truth normally piss you off?' lol. i'm not surprised that a skinhead and potential kkk member thinks that his perspective is absolute while everyone else's is inferior."
sarc,i love when differing from someones opinion is 'weak'. such a convincing argument.
sarc,"i am surprised to hear you, a card-carrying christian, defending the civil rights of polygamists! wonders will never cease!  obviously the point flew right past your noggin. gay people are discriminated against because they are gay! but then, you folk think that's just fine. a few years ago, you'd have been blowing hard about 'activist' judges allowing interracial marriage. how dare they stand up for equal rights! emoticonxrolleyes"
sarc,"child, your assumption is not only simplistic, childish and patently ridiculous, but it is coming from you so i'm not surprised at all that you're making it. you can deduce and somehow read into my rejection of your statement being evidence of anything is claiming that christianity is the only religion, but i made clear above that my only intent was to show that your claim that your siggy proves anything at all is patently absurd. but make of it what you will. i'll give you the last word to spew your lies and delusions about what you want to say i believe. so have at it little boy, er, i mean, child. emoticonxbye"
sarc,774 billion to china in debt... where are you going to 'buy' new technology? oh right... from china.
sarc,"lol, i love how everyone seems to feel the need to out-wit rk even after over 50 days xd"
sarc,"archie, it's already 'cleared up' that you're a liar. you claimed to know what he was about. you claimed it was a 'secular site that's dedicated to exposing the homosexual, extreme left, communist and anarchist agenda'. but he's not really interested in 'homosexuality' at all. and i find you're 'couldn't find it' to be incredibly absurd. it's on the web-page where he talks about the event in the first place. if you actually start clicking to see the pics and his comments, it's right there! i'm not linking to pornographic material on this web-site. the header of that web-page reads:  'up your alley fair san francisco, july 27, 2008 part 1' i am incredibly amused that you repeatedly lie all over the place on this web-site, but then you press others for proof."
sarc,"oh hun i am sorry, i'll get right on that :) but yes i retouched her scars, she's a cutter for sure..."
sarc,"she was never 'pro-gun' to you people. she was an anti. omg they reported on something. not exactly ready to help her reputation out before she was shot, though, were they? you have lots of bros that are lunatics. and one of them just shot and murdered 6 people, including a federal judge who was sitting on an immigration case and a congresswoman who opposed to arizona's immigration law. arizona: your land of cowgirl jan and cowboy sheriff joe.  i never heard of anyone who truly understood what a soul was, who thought they didn't need a mirror. i'm not surprised you think yourself at the level of god himself, able to judge who has a soul and who doesn't. it's the same psychology your bro with a gun just demonstrated."
sarc,"it's my first day and i'm already wishing forums had an ignore button. this really is my first day, and i am frankly flabbergasted. is this (archie-types) an ongoing problem here, or an isolated individual? i feel like i'm arguing with my 6 year old niece. i'm asking everyone out there who has been there for a while. seriously. as a former christian, i have numerous christian friends whose conversation and opinions i respect and think i could learn something from - but, well...jesus, is this the norm around here? this is not a rhetorical question."
sarc,"she? uh, you don't know me like that, miss thing. you're the one with more pudenda than the pointer sisters. and i'm not eating any attention. i'm mildly amused. i haven't seen any evidence of your reputed prowess here. and why don't you ask the real monkey to dance? somebody at home."
sarc,oh dear.another one that gets a hard on when they see a typo....emoticonxchicken
sarc,"first of all, let me just say that that is an excellent whitesnake song. but i'm a little surprised!emoticonxwow all the complaints i got about giving out my personal problems and here you are complaining about wanting a relationship. does no one else see the irony in this? the problem is obvious to me. okay i take that back, it really isn't. does going to kichen supply stores really help?"
sarc,"i'm shocked! shocked, i say!!! you seem so pure! roflmao....sorry!"
sarc,"wrong again daewoo; but at least you are painfully consistent. i am merely pointing out the hypocrisy and level of ignorance obama displays every time he opens his economically clueless and divisive mouth. but then, who would ever accuse you of getting anything right? once again, the buffet rule is for the gullible and clueless to glom onto in a vacuum of reality and the fact that it would do nothing to solve this nations problems and is merely a diversion from the massive failure this president has been, more so than even carter.  i cant say i am surprised you would glom onto such an idiot talking point.  it is only strange for someone who is so completely clueless that they cannot even comprehend a simple thread premise.  so were you born this clueless, or deliberately play the role of someone who is patently clueless?"
sarc,"if we killed more people that were guilty of their crime more people would not want to commit the crime because of the circumstances. if they don't care about the circumstances they are insane. 'i think, about what they've done wrong in society is by teaching/encouraging/inspiring them, not killing.' so you want the government to brainwash them?  are you kidding me? what planet do you live on?! 'oh, you killed someone but we're not going to punish you at all you just have to go to therapy.' you're joking right?"
sarc,"i'm always astonished that creationists try the 'lots of cultures have stories about floods' gambit.  yes, lots of cultures have stories about many things. either there was one great flood at one time, or there have been individual floods. since humans tend to congregate in river valleys, i think i know why all the flood stories contradict each other..."
sarc,"were it so simple. for the agents to 'freely assemble' among us they, or their superiors, must conclude that we are some sort of threat. would that make you feel loved? on a side note, i'm always surprised at how 'conservatives', normally so worried about government waste, take such a waste of taxpayer dollars so glibly. fbi investigating kiss-ins? joining subversive 'terrorist' xxxx biker groups?"
sarc,"oh, how about the other states charge a special fee to inspect anything imported from kalifornia? seems like there was a little trade war going on over oj from florida and texas once and kalifornia lost.  what does the constitution of the u.s. say about powers prohibited to the states? reckon kalifornia is bound by the u.s. constitution? emoticonxagree"
sarc,"i love it when straight, christian folk who disapprove of gays seem to know so much about what it is to be gay - how it feels, how they became that way, the nature of their relationships and whether or not its something they can control. hey archangel - if you ever need brain surgery i know a fantastic auto mechanic you can talk to. emoticonxrolleyes"
sarc,"oh yes matt, i'm just an angry little ogre who can't stand to think that gays might find happiness in this lifetime, [sarcasm]. get a clue matthew, i have no personal investment at all regarding your life or your lifestyle. all i'm doing is sharing the spiritual truths that you hate to hear or consider. don't blame me because you live a life of delusions and self deception, because that is the life you are living. and none of those so called good people who encourage and show tolerance for your chosen lifestyle are your friends at all. and yet you prefer their lies to my truth. go figure huh?"
sarc,wow nice job! the 50 character limit is hard to reach and it is a waste of time but up vote for you!
sarc,"that's me, and proud of it. but i guess you get your jollies when pagan religious symbols or a pagan religious event can be displayed / practiced, but to heck with anything that might resemble christianity? real nice and equitable there, moose.  it got me a lot of 'excellent!' and 'way to go!' remarks from a number of co-workers.  bull. i've seen it, though it's been many decades now. get real. halloween itself is a pagan religious event, if you will do some research for a change. once again, pagan-related religious themes are fine, but screw the christians.  aren't you one of the libs who tries to sell their 'tolerance' (except for anything christian)? reckon so."
sarc,"i have several that i want everyone who engages in the 'man caused global warming' debate to consider.... and i thank you for helping to illustrate some of those points for me (bold text above). asside from the points we've already discussed,... i am a bit intrigued by the fact that many of your ilk (concerned about saving the lives of millions by reversing or slowing the warming trends of the planet) are seemingly oblivious and uncaring about the millions who are deliberately killed in the name of 'choice.' isn't the decision to drive an suv a choice as well? emoticonxrolleyes"
sarc,not likely waxy: i just thought snakespit's scornful post would have been more effective if he hadn't used 'dear' three times when he meant 'deer'.
sarc,"your reputation  la savoir faire with dirty notes precedes you, darling. no need for mommy's little boy to wiggle down his pants and expose himself some more. meaning, too, your ignorance, not mine, since the connection between the vietnam war, rubber production and american tire manufacturers is documented and known. go visit your local c.i.a. source for further information, dw, for starters.  be sure to take your teacher clown nosey with you."
sarc,Al will need to get a little fitter before the fight but I reckon he could take him! 
sarc,"this seems like a begging the question fallacy. lets just assume that they 'do not' have control over it...it would be the same thing for an alcoholic (which people are also born with). are you saying alcoholics should be allowed to live in this lifestyle? i guess it is societies fault emoticonxrolleyes looks like jyoshu's reactions were correct for you i am pretty surprised no one is like 'yeah, this is still a problem'..instead they are going '25%...that aint too bad'. even worse, they blame other people. in fact, robbie says gay men are acting 'recklessly' because they aren't treated as 'normal', yet he believes that gay men are ready to have families. how can you be reckless yet be ready for a family?..or rather, a good family?"
sarc,"isn't that amazing that you were the fool all along? oh wait, you are to simple-minded to understand that. carry on."
sarc,That has to be a typo my friend. If you can compress the EB into only 1012 bits then you can write your own ticket in the field of data compression! Lets see 100 million pages into 1012 bits - fantastic - please tell us how. I really would like to put the entire literature of mankind (and more) on an Ipod. 
sarc,"gee, i'm just bowled over by your mature and articulate counterargument.emoticonxrolleyes we all know genitals have nothing to do with sex."
sarc,i am none too surprised to see that the point was totally and utterly lost on you.
sarc,i so love it when you have to work so hard to avoid any points i made. i take it as assent to my original post.
sarc,"wow, so everyone else is just wrong. no chance you could be? i am willing to bet that you also disagree with many christians or they disagree with you at least."
sarc,"wow, in your very warped world view, people with moral values that defend the most defenseless among us and speak for those who can't speak for themselves are seen as morally perverted by you? how terribly pathetic of you capo. but sadly, i'm not the least bit surprised at how incredibly shallow your perspective is. what boggles the mind though is that you're unable to empathize with a whole class of human beings whom you once were yourself. just think about it capo, can you see what that say's about you?"
sarc,psh if i had to f*&^ hillary i'd cheat too! i mean i'm gay but lord have mercy! lol... but getting back to the subject at hand. simone hun honestly just stop with the cook theories and whoever else even believes them. bush and dick had no idea of 9/11 we all didn't.  i find it a sad irony that we discover the warning signs after the incident... we're only human and we all make mistakes... oh and fyi we did not land on the moon.. simone told me it was made of cheese and that there were giant moon rats eating and eating until one day the moon will be gone... that's why there are holes in it. it's true!!! honestly!
sarc,"reckon you'll be eating your own words in due time, moose.  not from what i've seen so far in your posts. keep plugging, though, you may find god yet when you run out of all those ill-conceived arguments against him."
sarc,"wow, i am surprised you didn't say 'kill the retards.'"
sarc,"there it is, at the top in bold letters. reckon you can find it now?"
sarc,'some people just need killin'' - that sounds just fantastic!
sarc,"leroyjames, i am just shocked at your blatantly sarcastic response to kelly ;)"
sarc,"yes..but what is the difference between killing for fun and killing by mistake???? you drive your big suv to work every day...how many animals do you accidently kill? how many insects? oh wait, you judge a life by how big the life is...ignorant humans!"
sarc,i was not trying to convince anyone. so what the hell is your point man? oh right there is no point. you are just trying to be an uncouth lout.
sarc,"oh yes...because mainstream science is concocting one big hoax just to brainwash you. it's a conspiracy of rabid scientists. emoticonxrolleyes we all know you know much more that scientific peer reviewed journals and the scientific method, right? you're scientific credentials?"
sarc,"no i'm not. well you certainly should be. to me it doesn't matter how the fetus got there, and seriously, why is it relevant for you to know that? wow...i'd say i'm surprised but i'm really not. so you're saying that people who don't want a baby stupid enough to have unprotected sex are on an equal playing field with those who properly applied protection which failed? that's ludicrous and you really should know better.  well. with condoms.. you have no baby. and with abortion, you don't have any baby either.. you left out a few important details there buddy. with the killing of a 3-month old with an axe you have no baby. but its the same result! yippee!"
sarc,jesus christ srom!!! you live in the stone age... i'm surprised you have internet access.
sarc,"well, i am not surprised you think science is a cult. i guess you think everything you don't understand is a cult. emoticonxrolleyes"
sarc,i totes love how your arguments doesn't even tell us what your answer is since you laughed a question that had two sides open for agreement or disagreement.
sarc,"and yet you ignored the specific link mentioning the current regs while asking for it at the same time.  no, i dislike your techniches because they are unethical, hold double standards, and aren't based on facts.  oh yes, who was the one who asked for the reg link while ignoring it at the same time?  the fact that you quote newsmax says much about how much credence anyone here gives you."
sarc,"that explains your excellent use of grammar, word choice and spelling? rotflmao"
sarc,oh no you didn't! not g earnst website?  oh yes you did! that would be like me quoting from nato's website.  po tow mack institute emoticonxsmilie  potomac river humm.
sarc,the evidence that is provided to you is not enough. not that evidence is not given.  nice closed-minded-ness buddy.  ethnocentrism? lol! you're kidding right? you think what i wrote is particular and not broad ranged? what are you assuming here?
sarc,"oh yes, the flood that left no trace of ever occuring. gotta fear the threat of nothing! i'm so afraid of a flood that never happened!  as for sodom, well, i practice good hospitality. i don't know about you. you know, god isn't going to be happy when you keep limiting its power by calling it a 'he' all the time. god is limitless, it has no gender."
sarc,"which leaves us with? if you said 'an appeal to majority' you win teh prize! you're not really leaving it to them when you're talking about enacting legislation based on a theory which is still under debate. most doctors won't prescribe marijuana in this country either. i guess we should just leave that to them though, since they're more qualified."
sarc,"anyone else see the irony? i don't have time to look up my facts, but i'll just say my opinions are facts!  let's just ignore that overall, republican adminstrations have more officials indicted or convicted of state & federal laws. nixon's adminstration alone accounts for many of the republican number (golwater called nixon the most dishonest person he'd ever met in his life). and do we need to remind jim of the ratio of republicans who have gone to jail or been indicted compared to democrats in the past 6 years?  right. strom thurmand laughs at you from his grave.  with a ideology like that, i'm not surprised."
sarc,"so.... whats he been doing for the past two thousand years? i'm sure this rapture probably requires a lot of paperwork.... i mean, if you're going to torture and murder millions of people i guess you better have all your t's crossed and i's dotted huh?"
sarc,"loll i love how you completely ignore the link i posted ehh?? and then you downvoted me and tried to sound smart afterwards, but actually made yourself look like twice a fool. :d. you better upvote me again. smh. hah."
sarc,i love how you managed to advocate reading the bible all the while pile slamming insults on it. pure brilliance. :d
sarc,"oh yes we do think so. as you know very well where that figure came from.  the latest study at harvard. new study finds 45,000 deaths annually linked to lack of health coverage | harvardscience interesting, isn't it, how our side is always quoting figures from harvard and such, and all your ilk can dig up is 'townhall' and hannity's second grade collages."
sarc,i am not his buddy. my objection was that you thought he was english( please tell me he's not) and that your perception of english people was wrong and insulting i do not care whether american ( or should i be a prat like you and call you a yank?)people carry guns or not and have never supported his argument. looking at some of your stupid smug posts i am not surprised that you need a gun for protection. look in the mirror fella and you will see penfold mk ii.
sarc,yes let's all cheer on the glorified shameless point-farming bitch of this site.
sarc,"i love it when christians say this...pay who, for what, whose sin? if he is god, no one had to die for anything. he could blink his eyes and everything would be as he wanted!"
sarc,"wow, this was up to 6 points at one time. down-voting it without a rebuttal surely refutes it."
sarc,"oh yes that was very enlightening, could i get the stick drawing anyway?"
sarc,you sound like such a great guy deliberately pissing off a person you call your friend. if that is what you call good works then i am truly impressed.
sarc,"no my dear, nor am i one of those cuckoo-brains who believe that obama is the best thing since sliced bread."
sarc,"wow! well what do you think that thing is in a woman's womb? a giraffe? with how stupid you are, i wouldn't be surprised if you were a giraffe,"
sarc,tennis? you're joking right? it's already been proven that women can take on a man anytime in that game! others not so much but tennis most definately!
sarc,"oh yeah, you got me. bigotry and hate are major turn on for me. you could use a good lay anyway. muah. ;0"
sarc,oh yeah because someone else getting involved and helping them wage war on palestine for daring to live in their own country is really likely to prevent the war from escalating.
sarc,"nor do i understand how buying materialistic items or receiving them is very christian yes!!! thankyou!!! i'm glad someone finally said it! now what was one of the deadly sins of christianity? oh right, greed. hypocrisy much?"
sarc,"huh. explain why you call people bush haters and use personal attacks yourself when you're running out of ammo? oh yes, it's because you're a hypocrite. i'm voice of treason, i can call people all the horrible names i want, but the minute they say one bad thing about me, i whine like a little girl about how it;'s so unfair and how they are meanies!"
sarc,"as i said, for clarification, and no other reason. it's all drivel to me anyway, so i didn't see the problem in adding evolution onto theory. show where it said that if you would, and clarify your question. if you'll notice, it said approximately, not exactly half its life. i'm surprised you couldn't deduce that by just reading what it said. why are you asking me this question smiley as if i wrote the article? can't you tell the difference between quoting a piece and writing it?"
sarc,"'Life threatening condition that is always physically harmful""? What a giant load of steamy BS. Rarely is pregnancy physically harmful and even rarer is it life threatening. There are over 6 Billion people on this earth today. If motherhood was so damn dangerous, don't you think the population would be a lot lower, even if it was just due to mothers keeling over after giving birth? Where do you get this BS from, Planned Parenthood? "
sarc,"only you would consider accepting donations equivalent to charging a fee moose. as if the two are at all similar. after all, one is a mandatory charge, while the other is an optional donation.  and i'm not going to defend the rapture at all, but don't you think it's a bit premature to assume it will never happen?"
sarc,oh yeah. way easier. which is why gay marriage has come such a long way since it started. ;) marriage would only be removed from any legal document. it will still appear in religious documents. the compromise will be a hell of a lot more amicable than the tension that currently exists.
sarc,"oh yeah, it's a real brain teaser. who would have thought it's possible for someone to have two parents?"
sarc,i'm surprised that some of the more frothing liberals here have not yet suggested that we now have a way of tracking and potentially treating the 'abnormal' brains of conservatives.
sarc,"i'm surprised to learn that you have the slightest idea about biology. also, your spelling and grammar is ever so much better in this post than your posts in another thread. how many of you are pretending to be a poster named vt?"
sarc,you're kidding right? the quangbar tangrians will be abducting you and the rest of the human souls at the end of the world. everyone knows this.
sarc,"i love how the government has become the scapegoat for the failure of parents to control their kids, and in turn we are losing more and more civil liberties..."
sarc,"to be honest, i'm surprised it was that hard to give a corporate handout. any big insurance company and big drug company is delighted since their competition will now be squashed and the average joe will delight in their weaker care at a higher price. but hey, a for effort, right? emoticonxrolleyes you don't get points for failing to deliver or delivering a failure in my opinion."
sarc,i am surprised scientists havn't made so much of a fuss about you. wow......
sarc,"ok, the absolutly positively true story. god did exist. but, satan being the wiley deciever he is got him with that very clever paradox ploy. 'god, if you are truely all powerful, can you make yourself not exist?' satan asked. 'but of course.' he replied and with that...*poof* he was gone. that explains why he doesn't do anything. no miracles, no prayers answer, nothing...he's gone. and, for those fools who doubt this, i refer you to the book of job. witness how god jumps to the tune of satan when god withdraws his protection from his loyal and faithful servant...merely to prove a point to satan...without cause!"
sarc,i love how you point out the obvious . like what's already been implied in the statement. lol.
sarc,"a: when it comes to civil rights, the'majority' does not rule!!!!!!!!!!! i suggest you 'float your boat' in the direction of the vatican city, as you have already proven that your first allegiance is to there, not to the usa of which you presume to be a citizen. emoticonxrolleyes  so what would you have us do? stand by silently while you promote the dogma of a sovereign foreign power (vatican city) to control the rights of us citizens? with your bigoted attitude, i am totally surprised yu are not advocating a constitutional ammendment to make the rcc the one, only, and required legal religion in the usa with the pope as chief executive. emoticonxrolleyes emoticonxrolleyes"
sarc,"wow!! your such a guy! i bet you watch lingere womens football too dont you. womens basketball is on a much higher level then men. i bet you couldnt even tell me what a shot clock, three point shot, foul shot, or even what layup is. maybe if your tried watching womens basketball you would see how it is on a high skill level and how some wnba teams could beat mba teams."
sarc,lol bias dysfunctions. i'm surprised you know such a long word. pity you don't know what it means. i can't blame you... being a retarded ignorant white woman. you don't even understand the absurdity of your own beliefs. go back to cleaning the house. worse is that you don't work yet you take the piss out of immigrants who work but don't pay taxes. you're better how?
sarc,i know! i should totally be sorry and ashamed for being such a horrible liar... i mean a dick sucking homosexual and a liar! oh i'm going to the seventh circle for sure... except one little tidbit easilyridden. i didn't lie!!!  embarrass? hun you forget who wears the tiara in this forum....
sarc,"i do not understand how sexism, slavery and filicide fit into a being that is supposed to be infinitely moral. care to justify that for me? oh wait... you can't."
sarc,oh yes those horrible wicked gays that will distroy families and consume morality as we know it.
sarc,"oh dear, he already added to the gene pool. emoticonxrolleyes"
sarc,"seven demons, huh? is that a lot? small chance of clean living with those guys on board, huh? interesting. i am intrigued that you believe in demons. do they still exist? if so, how are they manifest and how would you know that?"
sarc,i'm surprised that so many people got their knickers in a knot over the ramblings of pat robinson. emoticonxwow
sarc,"i just told you how. if you want to change your gender, then go ahead... but comparing it to changing clothes is just idiotic.  oh yeah! i forgot, you already think the entire human race is stupid... so i guess you have an excuse."
sarc,"i assume you are christian? do you follow everything in the bible? i guess you better get stoning of your neighbors going then for working on sunday and wearing blended fabric. oh yes i do take offense that you want to kill gay people since you believe that you can't ignor some parts of the bible. you are then comanded to kill gay people, prostitutes, and smartmouthed children."
sarc,"oh yeah, that's right.... i forgot ;) i'm getting dementia already ;) well, i guess that if i don't make it to heaven (due to all the liberals i've tormented over the years) i'll be so busy shaking hands with all of my friends that i wont have time to worry ;)"
sarc,oh yeah? tell that to the next person you see running down the street wielding a knife. ;)
sarc,"i'm surprised that your picture doesn't precede the phrase 'ignorance of actual american history' in every encyclopedia on earth, simone. emoticonxdonno emoticonxfrazzled emoticonxic emoticonxwow"
sarc,"i am more amused than anything else. i don't have to 'attack your character', you do a much better job at showing exactly what you are made of than anybody else can."
sarc,i just like the author...i'm surprised a single person even knows who he is with the level of society's litterary intelligence. emoticonxsmilie
sarc,"i love it when people manipulate statistics in order to attempt to prove a causal relationship that doesn't exist. considering the fact that more women vote than men, one could argue that their views are over-represented. "
sarc,"what a shock. easy can't make a cogent point, so he starts ranting scripture and threatening damnation. let me type up his response: '<flush> let's see how smart you are when you're suffering in the pit, you obama-ade drinker.'"
sarc,"wow, there you go again. first we can cut health care costs by hiring lots and lots of doctors and nurses and building lots more hospitals... which have to be, you know, paid for. now we can cut postal rates by hiring lots and lots more delivery people! who have to be, you know, paid. in your view it seems that any cost can be reduced by spending more money... it's fascinating really."
sarc,"i hope you're joking, otherwise i suggest you see a psychiatrist as soon as possible. people are more important than animals. you can like animals, you can even love animals, you can not want to eat animals, but when you start thinking they're more important than babies you have serious issues."
sarc,"yes, that is certainly going to stop you from a gunman. 'dear god.... please save this soul'"
sarc,"wow, you're clever. and some things are dumb. ex, choosing to die when you have the option to live. your lame analogies aside, (yeah, i used the word lame again) one can find new people to hang out with. and again, instead of answering my arguement, you decide to try and insult me. you're right, i must be the one who is dumb..."
sarc,"i'm quite surprised this hasn't got more attention. usually all you have to do is whisper the word abortion around here and there's a firestorm. not that that was what i was going for, i'm just surprised. maybe this article is just too straightforward for people emoticonxangel"
sarc,"never said anything about a 'lost speech'. but who knows? he may have had his speech writers prepare half a dozen different speeches. the community organizer knows when to push and when to back off. there was enough of a public outcry for him to realize that this was not the time to push. so he backed off and wasted the country's time by re-hashing old wisdoms. i am rather amused about the labels thrown out by you, simon and foundit. just because i had the audacity to criticize the anointed one i am a hysterical racist. keep them coming."
sarc,"atheists believe in god.... they just don't want to believe in god because they are in rebellion to god maybe in your mind, because you can't see a world without god. a parallel is that of a parent and child. so atheists are naughty children? and he or she then rebells to the point of extreme anger. atheists are extremely angry? oh right, like those atheist terrorists, or the atheists that campaign at the funerals of dead soldiers. atheists are just angry at god for no real reason care to prove this?"
sarc,i guess i'm not really surprised at some of the reaction here: ignorant blather. i am dissappointed though. it's amazing what people will say about something with no knowledge of it. yes.
sarc,More heretical misinformation from dear old cap0.  'Zionism is Racism' - a Dead Issue 
sarc,"reproduction oh yeah, because our 7 billion high population, with estimates for 10 billion by the end of the century, really needs to force gay people to do it. if the person is religious in the christian religion, it only damns those who sleep with another man as he does a women. your sexual orientation itself is not bad. and anyway, it's their own problem, love the sinner, hate the sin, as jesus said. i'm not sure about other religions specific text against gays. if he wants to. i talked about how people shouldn't be forced to, i said that some people could."
sarc,"the moon is made of cheese because i said so. was i persuasive? neither were you. do you have the capability to actually debate with facts? you saying something is true doesn't make it so. oh, and i'll save you the trouble.. i'm going to burn in hell, i'm, how does it go? spiritually challenged? and oh yeah, i'm going to bring about something called rapture or something like that. lol"
sarc,wow! i've never thought about it like that. you've given that a lot of thought ;)
sarc,"a minute without kids? what's that? :) and about the thread - it might be a touchy subject. reckon? oh, and thanks - i feel 28! emoticonxcool"
sarc,"what a shocker. let me paraphrase: anyone: not following you aa, can you support or clarify what you're saying here? aa: nope!"
sarc,"i probably wasted time creating this debate. everyone knows blacks commit more crime than other races. who in their right mind is going to argue with that? oh wait, aveskde would argue with a sign post if it was crucial to holding his fantastical world-view together, maybe he'll bite. :)  you're projecting. you'll find that few things enrage me or emotionally motivate me."
sarc,"what are they doing at the marshals service anyway besides losing two way radios? maybe, they should just radio it in to find them, oh wait, they can't, they are lost."
sarc,"i love it when hypocrites say that we are no longer old testament law but proceed to quote the old testament that they just dismissed making themselves out to be fools and hypocrites. you can not have it both ways. either the old testament applies, or it does not. also, do you play football, wear polyester, stuff like that? those are abominations too. for more abominations, read leviticus 11. damn, this is a jolly good time!"
sarc,"oh really? ever voluntarily flown in a plane by any chance? taken medication for anything, or received a vaccination?"
sarc,"i can't help it if fairy tales are dear to your heart dude, i'm just telling it like it is.  christians all over the country try to claim the gospels are in harmony..and very rarely , if ever, have i found a christian who will admit the contradictions in the bible. they try to explain away contradictions with lies and made up versions of their own but will never admit the truth.... no loss here, i have never since i came here hid the fact i do not like religion. it's nothing personal against anyone in particular, but if you happen to be religious and fall under the weight of truth i can't help if your feelings get hurt. would you rather me feed you a line of xxxx so you will fall for it, i mean come on, religion already did that right>.....emoticonxbouncer"
sarc,"<sarcasm mode on> it's sexual assault because when she sobered up and realized what she'd done, the little darling couldn't possibly have been responsible for her own actions.  <sarcasm mode off>"
sarc,"where were you when we discussed this twice previously?  nice slur, good way to show your false 'compassion' emoticonxcry depends where it hits. two to the center and one to the head is the accepted protocol. i posted dr. fackler's, the leading authority on 'wounds', previously. did you miss it and the miami dade shooting events? scroll back dearie."
sarc,"i had expected better, so i'm mildly surprised to see this poster limbo gaily beneath the unspeakable basement standard set by his comrades in arms. emoticonxconfused"
sarc,"oh yeah, all the most famous scientists, composers, writers, bands. all girls of course.... no, not really. yeah whitney huston, obviously way bigger than the rolling stones, beatles, who, led zeplin...... yeah great. take a step back, and read some good literature, you might learn something, un biased. opera the most powerful woman on earth> if she is, why will she die in the next 30-40 years, and how come i had never even heard of her until a little while back? how come, if she is so powerful, she is not out curing terminal diseases. oh i guess sitting on some leather sofa trying to get more ratings is way better!"
sarc,"Sweetie, if every gay person were as wealthy as Mary Cheney, we could laugh all the way to the bank and ignore the prejudice in society the way she does. Indeed, we'd probably be the darlings of the GOP. Unfortunately for your delusion, gays are no more or less wealthy on average than anyone else. "
sarc,and neither did god write them. they were writen by men and there was no devine inspiration. there is no difference between the bible and margaret mitchell's gone with the wind. oh yes i am sorry gone with the wind at least gets history correct.
sarc,"jyoshu, for someone who is so sure of his opinions, i am surprised that you have chosen to ignore my challenge to you statement - (btw, inseparable is spelt with an 'a'. :) ) leo"
sarc,"that sounds a lot like another species... what is it called... oh, right, humans! have no predators to fear? check. grown high in numbers? check. a danger to all other animals and humans alike? check. so, here's an easy way to curb the numbers... let's hunt them!"
sarc,i just love how you attempt to be mr. forum police here steve. if you want to be a moderator so bad why not apply? i'm certain this board could use the help. as far as your scenario it's rather laughable but whatever. point being is if people demand evidence why not give them that? i'd rather be an open honest man than hide behind a handle any day.
sarc,"violence, death, conflict, etc. yet god is the one who condones all that. in fact who considers most of it right. BEGIN QUOTE he doesn't care about what's right and not right. END QUOTE oh yeah, god really does not care about those at all. considering all that he regards as good (slavery, raping, killing children, etc.) BEGIN QUOTE he has no remorse for his actions.END QUOTE  it just gets better and better... BEGIN QUOTE sure, you don't have to worship him,  END QUOTE only an idiot would worship god. BEGIN QUOTE but i don't think he encourages people to grow and live their life the 'moral' way. END QUOTE this is so true. god is not moral, not even remotely close."
sarc,yep. you got it.  i'm so busted.  seriously. you were a lot closer with the 'abusive participant' thing and i'm surprised that you (of all people) took the line that you did. cheap shots like that are not something that you are known for.
sarc,"really? damn! i wanna be awesome too. are you selling awesomeness or do i have to develop it on my own? if it's a lot of work, i might just settle on being mediocre."
sarc,the aussies are banning publications and films of women with small breasts. if you think that mens mags like nuts are pornographic you are a little sad..dont mix with other men much..mother told you sex was dirty? oh dear the porn expert is insinuating that i must be getting my rocks off..see above:) graphic depictions of rape are freely available in videos and so are not 'rare'. expert on slasher films with 'teenage trollops getting killed...see above:)
sarc,"geeze, oldsarge, i'm sorry you missed the rabies shots when they were passing them out. i'm surprised to see you still around frothing at the mouth."
sarc,"'they give both sides of the isle a chance to talk.' oh yeah, us liberals are free to talk on fox...  we just aren't allowed to defend ourselves when our statements are taken out of context, correct you when you misquote or misread soemthing for the benefit of your stance on a topic, or have the last word.... other than that, we may speak...."
sarc,i love it when you bash people for stating opinions and no facts when you turn around and the same thing...i take it you have proof of a lie (keep in mind that lying is not the same as being wrong). as for hagel...i will assume he is actually in iraq right now and wrote that. give me a break emoticonxrolleyes
sarc,honestly did not know that acorn was such an evil organization that was based on evil-ness.  but really acorn seems like a very good organization based on helping those in need of help. i was under the impression of something totally different. i guess don't believe what you hear on fox news =]
sarc,"wow, so you're saying that christianity should be able to stand the test of extreme scrutiny? are you trying to use this as an excuse to bash it time and again? great idea! i think you should spread the wealth a little! bash some hindus and buddhists and jews! oh, wait- no that is discrimination!!! you racist! i think that christianity has definitely should the test of extreme scrutiny long enough! millions of christians have been killed in history as martyrs."
sarc,"accountable by trial? by following the advice given to them? how about holding the advisors accountable? oh wait!! how about holding the people who put the advisors in power accountable? oh shit!!! hold the government accountable! hold the people who put government accountable. hold every citizen accountable. nice work, captain hindsight. you put yourself at trial. 'i shouldn't have acted like i know more about drilling for oil than oil companies'."
sarc,i love how marc is just detached from reality. i doubt he'll reply to how he's so wrong about the cases he listed. two can't even be found on findlaw.
sarc,"oh really? then please provide me with several links that prove i'm an idiot or shut the fuck up! considering you only have 30 points i'm not too sure just how much you could possible know about anyone on this site? come on dude! you're a troll and everyone knows it... stop your trolling, grow up and hang with the big dogs... if you can't then close your fucking troll account and go bye bye."
sarc,"oh yes. that's why the brits took fast and sure measures to round up the islamofascist jerks. wish we could do the same here, oh yes, i almost forgot.we are!!"
sarc,"what? don't they have boyfriends? i'm just amazed that they don't design all women shirts so that they come off easy. hell, they invented the easy access bra ;)"
sarc,"oh but he/ she is. his often speaks out to remind our dear mps that they are supposed to be leaders of our country, not school kids a playground. he does this by yelling 'order!' a lot. and he gets to wear a silly wig i think (or is that 'black rod'?) (ps, wilted_laughter is irish i think. your post sort of implies you think him english. calling an irishman 'english' is a crime even more serious than calling someone a 'liberal' in the usa :p)"
sarc,i love it how no mention of bush can go long without the word nazi! emoticonxrolleyes
sarc,"oh yes liberal: anyone who disagrees with vor regardless of their political standing. you would call frist a liberal if he disagreed with you, hell you would even goldwater a liberal if he disagreed with you.  i'm going to mentally replace farfignewgin whenever you say liberal, after all, they have the same meaning in your context.  you can support the troops by disagreeing with any mission that is unncessary in terms of security and any mission that puts troops in unncessary danger. explain to me how you can support the troops by supporting a mission that doesn't help america and gets 1600 of them needlessly killed."
sarc,"no.. go read the bible before you look dumber than you already do. sorry dear, ad hominems do nothing. it sounds like you're talking about something you know little about. i apologize i sound that way. i certainly know what i am referring to in the bible, and knowing that you have admitted you don't necessarily follow the whole bible (god > bible) i figured i wouldn't assume you believed in genesis adam and eve. but rather give you the option to say yes or no.  god didn't want us to be puppets.  i didn't necessarily say puppets. he wanted us to have free will, to do what we wanted -and if they did love him, it should be their choice. if sin wasn't created, we would have been god's puppets. so god was performing some twisted reverse psychology on adam and eve?"
sarc,"call it what you will - cry, whine, pout, 'put on notice', it's all the same to me. i wasn't trying to be profound that's for sure, apparently, you didn't see the humour either. :p i'm just really amused at how you've got your knickers in a bunch over the #%$# !@#$@ atheists that are coming to 'ruin' everything you cherish. :p the funniest thing, well there's two actually, one, you don't really have a leg to stand on legally despite your claims to the contrary, and two, the threat is mostly in your head. boo hoo. emoticonxcry  waxy"
sarc,"why thank you , and yes i guessed that as you are pretty busy grovelling to the hide and seek champ , so full credit to you and of course the invisible dictator ..., don be shy take a bow ....."
sarc,"i love how you are using violence to threaten people. when, your argument is disputing violence."
sarc,"fine lets just all be on our own, fuck government, fuck state, fuck town, fuck family, lets all do what we feel so long as it makes us happy. there has to be an order to things if not there will be chaos, history has proven this time and time again, but if you think that's the way to live be my guest, you will not live to long, the universe seeks balance and order not chaos. yes power will corrupt this is the reason for the system we have, like family, town, state, government and un to prevent the power hungry from taking over, it is up to us to prevent that from happening, we the people are the world not some lone wolf."
sarc,"see you know, lets all sign a petition to ban the doctor!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you know prodigee was right all along!"
sarc,"well, it's nice to know my assumption there was a dishonest ulterior motive (rather than actually wanting to discuss it) to the request was indeed correct. can't say i'm surprised though. this poster has consistently avoided actual discourse with most anyone with whom he'd find real disagreement (gasp!) for as long as i've known of him, usually choosing instead to throw his easy 'drive-by' insults from the peanut gallery. basically, he's a coward, and most anywhere else would probably be considered a troll."
sarc,"i do like written constitutions very much; and our constitution is not vague at all. in the first amendment, the question is not whether congress may make a law, but rather what is 'the freedom of the press?' this phrase has objective, historic meaning, and obscenity is not covered within that objective, historic meaning. neither, by the way, is the publishing of nuclear secrets. you have gathered incorrectly, for i do not want a direct democracy. how do you suppose we got 'civil rights' recognized in the constitution to begin with, matthew? did the words just magically appear there, or did a vast majority of people vote to put them there? oh yes, that's right, a vast majority of people voted to put them there. darn evil democracy! i say down with majority rule!"
sarc,i'm surprised he didn't google it. maybe that's too logical?
sarc,"i'm shocked! how could hunter mislead me so? emoticonxrolleyes given his previous output, i have to confess that i'm not at all surprised that this was a garbage in, garbage out moment. i feel slightly embarrassed at not stopping to consider the preposterous nature of a 14% figure though emoticonxembarrassed"
sarc,"so the quickest way to get over 20,000 points is to not be serious? check!"
sarc,"I can't believe that you would attempt to make such an insane assertion. Clearly, God was speaking about homosexual sex, but I'm not surprised that you left out the most unambiguous scriptural references. emoticonXRolleyes "
sarc,"wow, thanks for admitting how you really feel about sex apparently. never given your so-called 'wife' an orgasm eh? i sure could...lol..."
sarc,"wow, i don't understand how this keeps happening. i'll try to switch mice."
sarc,"And you have been refuted time after time. Lies, damn lies and statistics is a starting point. Its the false idea of the more powerless you render yourself the safer you will be. I bet you strongly believe its possible to pick up a turd by the clean end. "
sarc,"uh...how does that work? oh yes, comming from the person who thinks a cd is good during times of low inflation, it does not suprise me you do not even understand the basics of taxation."
sarc,"then explain why the moon isn't burning, after all, it's significently larger then any known comet.  this is beyond ignorant. explain how something far smaller then the moon could sustain nuclear fusion for millions of years yet brown dwarfs which are larger then the moon can't.  coronal mass ejections are not even similar to comets. we have evidence of what comets are. spectrum analysis of light given off by vaporization tells us exactly what they are made of. given your comments, i'm not surprised that the scientific contributions of the islamic world over the past 50 years have essentially been nothing."
sarc,"that wasn't a reason why we fought hitler. in fact, if you will remember many in the states didn't believe that occured until they saw the pictures.  hardly a reason to invade. unless you'd like to flip it around and say that every country who's leader we tried to murder has the same right. emoticonxrolleyes  how is that our problem? oh yes, it's not.  as i recall, we kicked him out, beat him up, put him under sanctions and virtually removed any ability to do anything of revelance.  doesn't that mean we have to invade north korea? emoticonxrolleyes  that's been dealt with already. rehashed arguments are worthless.  huh. stalinist govermemnt. reminds me of the dictators the us put in power in latin america. :) the mass graves also was dealt with. but then again, you clearly do not understand the me culture."
sarc,i love how the apple fan is illiterate. what exactly is the great thing that apple invented?
sarc,"that doesn't suprise me. again i'm not surprised that your first reaction to the idea that people aren't equal would be to enslave some and that your second idea would be to subjegate women. this reveals way too much about your nature. it ain't pretty. try living homeless for a year then get back to me on whether you saw yourself as equal to someone on '1million a year' emoticonxrolleyes now if the '1million a year' person gave the homeless person 1/2 million a year, then they would be equal, because equality is at the entre of such socialist ideals."
sarc,are you planning to be dead by age 40? i dunno. do you start to sag by then? wow! are you serious? his death is far worse because he's a total hottie? of course! if channing tatum died tomorrow i would cry. it's a total let down!!
sarc,"oh dear, and your argument against me is not based on what i've said, but what kind of person you perceive me to be. ouch!"
sarc,"more from unkerpaulie's list: 'world net daily' is a 'medical/scientific institution'????????????????????? from the website: unbiased??????????????????? really, unkerpaulie, i am surprised you didn't list fred phelps website in your 'medical/scientific institutions' list."
sarc,"he lives in arizona, a republican state. that explains everything."
sarc,"let's all listen to one religious book and base our laws off of that, regardless of any other beliefs that may exist, especially when regarding something that has little to no effect on anyone but those directly involved. that makes sense. lets all listen to one scientific theory and base our laws to teach that the earth is round. that doesn't make sense"
sarc,"oh yeah, they made all that stuff up for people who believe in that ;)"
sarc,"i love how you cling to hope that your god exists. dont you think its about time to stop the denials and face the facts? you actually believe that god has no time to help all of the starving people,  indeed. christianity are a fool for thinking that god is a good person"
sarc,"so basically, what you are advocating here is that public schools should teach no moral values whatever. they shouldn't teach tolerance, because that offends the intolerant; they shouldn't teach racial equality, because that offends racists; they shouldn't teach religious freedom, because that offends religious bigots. maybe they shouldn't teach the immorality of theft and murder because that offends thieves and murderers.  i am truly surprised to hear a right-winger such as your good self advocating that public schools should promote a moral vacuum. but then, i suppose anything is better than teaching acceptance of gay families as just another sort of family among the many that exist today."
sarc,what the? lmaorolf wow... easy i'm sorry but let me catch my breath... oh man you really are a card... if you couldn't tell my entire post was a joke you dimwitted nut job. always scrounging the bottom of the barrel for anything to use for ammo... did you stuff your brain in the cannon as well before you fired? and fyi i say hun to well almost all my friends as a joke... they know i'm gay but not flaming by any means and they get a kick out of it so lighten up and get the crucifix out of your hand and put it back on the wall alright?
sarc,"uncalled for, my nationality doesn't have much relevance to this, but nah you can go on pretending you're the only country in the world and shoot yourselves to hell, it's about what i'd expect. you see i hear something like the school massacre in europe, i am shocked, but in the usa it's a regular occurrence! but nah, you keep your guns if they make you happy, go play with your boom booms. i know 18 kids who won't have a happy christmas!"
sarc,"if i were a virgin it wouldn't insult me that you called me such a meaningless terminology. ignoring that nonsensical 'insult', i shall simply call you a man-whore and move along. as for the answer to the question, i will ask you why you try so hard to contribute constructively to a website that rewards you with nothing. oh dear, man-whore, that 'virgin' just burst your ego, what will you ever do?"
sarc,"you're joking, right?!?!?! you really believe books, teachers, computers, etc. are more important than a hungry child whose parents cannot afford to pay? wow..."
sarc,"hey i just aked a question ....... you think im evil , how would your mum have felt reading half the shit that comes out of your mouth. pfht fuck you darling. oh and i love you."
sarc,i think you underestimate the intelligence of a 6 year old and what they can comprehend............... and that 6 year old is not only the people but the future which makes it even more imperative that he or she know the sacrafices others have made to make this country the great country it is........ i am not surprised you call it brainwashing though....... emoticonxrolleyes
sarc,You betcha. Even JP who usually can defend such stuff has failed. VOR doesn't even bother (not surpisingly consider it requires brain usage)   The mere fact they let him do that is damning aganist the Vatican. 
sarc,"do you know what a marriage is under the law? oh yeah, that's right, a legal union. they are the exact same thing just with different names, its like if i had two identical roses and called them joe and sam, they're still both the same rose."
sarc,"i am amused by how some people can look at an article of an anti-gay marriage advocate attacking a gay marriage advocate, and the person reading the article wants to focus on what qualifies as 'oppression' and how gays could have it worse... emoticonxdonno  just out of curiousity, do you have any comment as to whether or not the attack was wrong?"
sarc,oh really? anybody can say that they are a always a guest on here and then all of a sudden come . nice try for an excuse.
sarc,"you don't know? oh yeah... you're supposedly married to that teenager, prodigee."
sarc,"if the federal government wants to pay for it, fine. the federal government has no business telling private insurance companies how to run their business. especially if they have religious ties. i'm surprised anyone wanted to put their dick inside your rotted out pussy."
sarc,"since we're at war with radical islam and they have attacked our homeland once already and have promised a repeat performance. it is ludicrous, irresponsible and suicidal to consider that investigating people of islamic descent before allowing them entry to be a discriminatory policy. especially since terrorists don't fight like men but are committed only to hit and die/run sneak attacks. but i'm not surprised that you're blinded by political correctness when you should be concerned about your families security. emoticonxrolleyes"
sarc,"lmao seriously i rarely show emotion, but that's funny. 1. how does that compare to 9/11 exactly? 2. at least that guy was aprehended, where's osama again? oh yeah that's right, we were busy in a random country in the mid-east because some president's daddy was there and jr wanted to show how cool he was. bush should have stuck to bankrupting professional baseball teams and oil companies. and conservatives have no leg left to stand on... literally your pirate avatar is fitting as insulting as you would wish it were. take out your peg leg and try to stand on an issue. current republicans = bought and owned by private interest. those sad soles defending it = easily persuaded and uneducated. i know because i'm an elite liberal. i regularly laugh at how dumb you are."
sarc,i'm shocked that people side with illogical arguments rather than logic.
sarc,"wow, lets all clap for that great argument for evolutionism. finally you are cheering for the correct side. personally, i'm not sure why this is being brought up again. it is funny how many of you religious people are so sure of your faith, but can't stand to see other people talk about how observable data doesn't fit with it."
sarc,"are you talking about this one??? he was talking about 'god'. he never said your 'god'. and i am both amused and bored by the fact that i just explained to you how evolution and a belief in a creator can co-exist, and you completely ignored it. but you're going to continue to claim that they are mutually exclusive, won't you..."
sarc,"oh yeah, but its okay to say that george bush is a criminal is it? no one wants to be fair then do they, lets be fair only when a democrat gets in trouble!"
sarc,i love when random myth followers talk about critical thinking :d
sarc,"wow, thats some poetic shit. i wonder to you roam around disagree with the people who boost about americas greatest, or how their a force for good. i wonder to you post wise ass comments next to these people. you have no idea how much of a hippocrit you are do you."
sarc,"woohoohoo, diogenes, talk about twisting my statements, wow! wow! i am just plain flabbergasted!"
sarc,"i'm doomed. yes, i love lobster, shrimp and even the impure oyster and other mollusks, i may be innocent of wearing linen and wool together but i can't be sure!!! doomed!!! oh, dear god, i'm doomed!!!!!"
sarc,"what is not only illogical but patently false is the assertion that the unborn baby is making his mother a slave of any kind. did that baby force her to conceive it? is that baby the equivalent of a tumor as the pro abortionists claim them to be? no, it is an unborn human being who just needs the time to grow and develop in order to be a sentient being just as we are as we type on these keyboards.  that explains everything about how irrational you are! but based on your posts though, i think they already pulled the plug. emoticonxfrazzledemoticonxdonno  "
sarc,"i love how what you 'personally' feel is in direct conflict with acedemic studies. science says force = mass times acceleration, but i personally feel that force = velocity times volume, so that must be the right answer."
sarc,"dear lisa, i want to tell you you're hot. hot as in every way possible. in fact, you should eat some peyote while you dance the tarantella. the way you smell like a goddess in heat makes me want to email you and ask you if you would consider this proposition: if you'll remove that top button i would have enough nerve to plop my large foot down, showing the massive wart to you. do you like warts? i hope so. there's this longing"
sarc,"oh yeah..., my fiends did that for me. they had an intervention and they vented. they were pissed me for mercilessly trolling them and it worked. i am now a kinder, gentler, troll ;)"
sarc,"let's see if i understand you correctly, because i think you may be on to something incredibly insightful. let's see, the island with males and females, uh, can reproduce, and, ... uh,  eureka, i've got it!!! you need a male and female to sexually reproduce!!!! that's ingenious!!!! you're brilliant, cool spot!! you're forgetting one thing. the island without the gay guys would not be nearly as fabulous."
sarc,"wow, these are some very nice values, lets teach them to everyone else! if the bible says so, why not? you seem determined to debate about a book of flawed values. are you sure you are defending this book of it's values? because surely you must have some kind of religious point of view to even think of protecting a piece of old literature."
sarc,"and bill clinton didn't? obama doesn't? emoticonxdonno let me help you with that. emoticonxangel she's a conservative! i'll bet her upcoming debate with biden will get far more attention than mccain/obama did! i'll sure be watching! word has it that the moderator is an obama lover.  i'm just surprised that so many consider it so important how one performs in these quick witted, personality contests. just because a person is slightly off the mark in wits doesn't mean he/she would not be a good leader - able to make sound political decisions.  looks aside, pelosi's a dingbat compared to palin. she gets a free pass from the news media - ho hum."
sarc,"btw, jazyjason, before you edited out your complimentary comment about howard dean. just wanted to say i'm surprised you said anything to associate yourself thus with a such an irrational far left commie. must stay with the mudflingers and lynch mobs and, especially if they're jesus lovers, ya know. so ... i understand why you took it down. merry christmas."
sarc,he is. it is like i sin a few times now i am a satanist. i was not aware that i could not have an opinon without being a satanist. you have been a christian longer: does god hate lying lips?
sarc,wowie! well shut my mouth and watch me wilt!!! lmao. 50times50
sarc,i disagree with it because there is no god. these are your words: 'i propose that a standard of good or evil cannot be defined by humans or human constructs.' i guess i shouldnt be surprised that i cant get a straight answer. you dont know. i am surprised your 'god' has not provided you with more adaquate ansures.
sarc,go back to the part in which we were discussing a specific case and stop trying to encompass the universe in your justification. (you know there are mothers in bokoboko that don't have enough lizard eggs to feed their babies so they eat them)emoticonxbanghead  i'm not surprised that a moral definition of selfish disgusts you. splat! :)
sarc,"i'm surprised no one has unearthed some stickman figures and announced that the drawings of jesus have been discovered, as recorded in john 8:7, where he's doodling on the ground while some poor young woman is about to get pelted with rocks. what a pilgrimage that would make..."
sarc,"be homophobic... like the naacp? oh wait, they're left wing. call for war... like the democrats for vietnam? oh wait, they're left wing. be racist... like claim that minorities can't help themselves? oh wait, that's also left wing. sir... you've engaged in stereotyping... that makes you... hmm."
sarc,i love it when the left dogs beck but blatantly shows their bias by not covering news stories detrimental to our pot-earred president. ;)
sarc,"agreed, and they are really grasping at straws now. i'm surprised that anyone still takes kennedy seriously. emoticonxrolleyes"
sarc,"according to what you mentioned previously, you violated the 'don't ask, don't tell' policy and came out of the closet, disrupting your unit. real classy, jazy. your gay sex sin took preference over honorable service. but then that's your idol, so i'm not surprised."
sarc,"you're kidding. just because your life is 'a fricken breeze' that doesn't mean the other 7 billion people on this earth have a breezy life. have you even watched the news lately? it's either that, or you live on another planet."
sarc,"then why have you attacked kerry and other democrats for voting aganist abortion bills that did not have such clauses?  oh yes, i know why, because you're a lying hypocrite."
sarc,"in that case its a single act of terroism so if you know all of this what's the name of his group? i wasn't on a high horse. also could you post the source saying he was part of some group and not just a loon.  jeez that sucks. *shrugs* well no different from black leaders who were targeted, slave owners/abolitionists who were targeted. this happens all the time. i'm surprised it hasn't happened earlier. i love how its a conspiracy! *roll eyes* its terrorism not a conspiracy. unless you gonna tell me the governments in on it. xd"
sarc,i love how you cons cry race card when someone points out obvious racism.
sarc,"Plain with the benefit of hindsight. I love how you're able to determine, not having been there, precisely what was said and precisely where it fell in relation to the law. If it was so clear, we'll see the prosecution for wrongful arrest in due course, I'm sure. "
sarc,"not really dearie, you're just ssdd. you're not unique or even all that intellegent. you just follow the crowd because you haven't an original thought in your head. but that's ok, we don't blame you, per se, we know you can't control your behavior. emoticonxrolleyes"
sarc,"well, there ya go! that explains everything gansao, we have been sincerely debating a serious issue of human development with a simpleton who gets his education from fictional tv. now i understand completely why it has been impossible to reason with him. we are officially wasting our time even communicating with such a person. emoticonxwow emoticonxdonno emoticonxfrazzled"
sarc,i love how scumbarge doesn't give a rebuttal to this. he knows you have him by the balls.
sarc,"i love how you claim that the teabag party is not affiliated with the republicans, who are they going to vote with ?.. the democrats?.. they may not claim to be republicans but last i checked we only have two major parties representing us in the house and senate, with maybe one or two independents.the tea bag party isn't big enough to control anything without republicans so enlighten me, who are they going to vote with to destroy what obama has accomplished so far?..."
sarc,"oh yeah? you can't out-post me! i type about 20 wpm. i still look at the keyboard when i type... which means, ultra-focus! i can switch between my right index finger and my left index finger. i'm a posting machine... try me."
sarc,"so your saying dr. tiggerroo, that my parents decided i would be gay for me. fascinating. do you have any other amazing rubbish to spit out of your mouth. i am captivated by your amazing intelligence on this subject. it sound like you have been studying this all through kindergarden. grow up, get a clue."
sarc,"oh yes, that time when you were on two ships at the same time in different oceans? or how about when you were a mid level naval officer who suddenly became a high level army advisor to the south vietnamese?  you're lying."
sarc,"wow a down-vote and no dispute, thanks kozlov (edit: or not kozlov?)."
sarc,"wow, you have a g.e.d. what happened? dropped out of high school? or did you flunk out? judging by you sentences (if you can call them that), you flunked out. and as for me, i have a computer engineering associates degree and i'm working towards my bachelors of science in computer engineering, so keep that in mind. i suppose the 'really important things' that you are learning that aren't reading and writing is how to roll a joint or take lsd since i couldn't imagine what a person who still lives in his mom's basement learns."
sarc,good grief... satanist?!.. my goodness how can you say such a thing?!  i will have to ban you for even mentioning the concept of it! my dear old fellow!
sarc,"oh, i agree with you...oh wait, did a clarify argument show up in the argument listing? damn! i think it did!"
sarc,oh yeah so our tax dollars pay for there asses to live in our prisons? no thanks our tax dollars are the ones feeding and bedding there asses
sarc,i just love how deliciously ironic this statement here is. well done.
sarc,"'wow my life my life is already turning out better then yours' what do you mean your life is turning out well? you live with your parents. you have no responsibilities, accomplishments, or qualifications for anything as you are 15. you are not even old enough to get a job, what are you talking about? ah i see you are related to jakej. i can't say i am surprised."
sarc,"fine lets just all be on our own, fuck government, fuck state, fuck town, fuck family, lets all do what we feel so long as it makes us happy. that is you doing the same damn thing, hypocrite."
sarc,"wow, good response. you know, attacking foul language instead of making a proper rebuttal makes you sound as uneducated and immature as you apparently are."
sarc,reckon if a rock could think it would have a concept or two.
sarc,"yes secular governments work. nor does it take much to see the philosophical similarities, as pointed out by trebor, between a religion, such as christianity or islam and communism, socialism, capitalism, totalitarism or a monarchy, but it does require an additional step, hence my comment of 2+2+2.  but just for kicks, let's say i am fully on board with communism as a religion and am now jumping ship on the idea. this would be the only reason you can give, other than what you have misunderstood which is explained abvove, that makes the study flawed. which doesn't take a genius to grasp makes no sense whatsover. so take your time, think about it, because there is an argument to made for your view and i am surprised nobody picked up on it, but let's see if you can figure it out on your own."
sarc,"well geeze pyg...i knew you were a bit itchy but i didn't know you hated gay people! i also didn't know you owned the 'internetz!' you must be related to al gore...how much did he soak you for his invention, lol? i don't know if you realized it but i'm gay too. yes indeedy little pyggy, shall i go back from whence i came or am i safe here with you? you seem to know what a 'rick roll' is so i'm impressed...'cause i've never heard the term."
sarc,"i love it how you every time someone disagrees with you, you call it 'attacking' :|"
sarc,i love how you managed to make a counter-troll sound like a serious reply :)
sarc,"of course it crossed my mind, but logic isn't allowed; this is religion. jesus isn't showing up or walking away from their bread munching wine drinking rituals. i am supposed to be surprised that jesus supposedly said just one more thing which makes no sense what so ever? the early church wasn't called catholic because there were no other protestants running around to differentiate between. if imagination alone could generate heaven, you would be right. i have no reason to believe heaven exists. which are based on the beliefs of the early church, which you have already admitted existed during jesus's life time."
sarc,"'slaves, tortures, drones, dictators' hmm, what does that sound like? oh yeah, the history of most european countries, including germany."
sarc,"oh really, a combination of the words expel and arm mean to expel arms? wow, she was a creative genius! i think what he meant was rowling just takes all the stereotypical magicy stuff and mashes it all together into a tacky and overused paste."
sarc,"i love how you are pro-choice until its a choice you don't like. let people carry guns in their own home. let them carry it on their person. it has nothing to do with you does it not? unless you deal with people threatening you with guns on a daily basis it doesn't. their house =/= their choice, her body = her choice?  i love hypocrisy."
sarc,"wowwwwwwwww. you learned how to say something other than 'you are going to hell'. did your mother teach you that, or are you just copying what i'm doing? cuz i doubt you are smart enough to learn anything by yourself."
sarc,"which post do you think most accurately demonstrates archie's ethics? is it the one(s) where he denigrates gays? the one(s) where he accuses those who disagree with him of being filthy, rotten liars, but is incapable of providing an example of their dishonesty? maybe it's the one(s) where he goes off on an insult laden rant that manages to break damn near every point of the tos? since i've just listed pretty much all of his posts, which one demonstrates archie's impeccable ethics the best? seeing as how you just accused a perfect stranger of having no ethics, simply because he disagreed with you, i'm not surprised you feel a kinship with archie."
sarc,"i love how iranian president alphabets kidnaps 15 sailors and marines, holds them captive on bs evidence, and then trys to act like the biggest humanitarian on earth by 'pardoning' them out of the kindness of his heart. personally, i think it would be nice for these 15 british troops to see the bombers going the opposite direction as they leave iranian airspace."
sarc,"i'm surprised archangel hasn't jumped on this.  he's gullible enough to fall for tv props, why not this?"
sarc,oh really? then why don't we go naked and live in a forest or jungle? ................ i did not mean to say that i say we are different but the same.
sarc,i am surprised that you were able to give a non troll answer.
sarc,"i'm a communist and i like pie emoticonxdonno how dare you. i'm almost offended but am so intrigued by your avatar that i get a happy feeling inside and forget about it. but please, next time, please consider the communists when using them as an insult. emoticonxgood *although this post is mostly sarcastic, i am being a little bit serious."
sarc,i guess since your know how to post without the 50 characters you are a half veteran but once you figure out behind what's behind the humor of joe's post you will be a full veteran. pay attention.
sarc,"i am impressed you are impressed by that backward-minded bigot who's main insight was a mere claim without justification on any form of harm to the institution of marriage and said, 'fuck the fags'? come on dude."
sarc,"wow many false gods beat an actual one. christinity may only believe in one god, the god."
sarc,"wow, lets all clap for that great argument for evolutionism. personally, i'm not sure why this is being brought up again."
sarc,"Oh, yea. You are damn right those European socialists are dangerous. Americans might look and see their governments actually doing something USEFUL for the people and think that we should have that here.  I am surprised we have not nuked them yet. "
sarc,"FILTER BY LACK OF ENGLISH WORDS. oh yeah..???????? emotion is juz lyk the engine vch pulls da coaches n help'em 2 reach 2 der destinantion as da coaches've no destination 2 move or 2 b pulled....da same way, if der's no emotion how da hell man can accomplish his goal nd destination......my dear competent frnd.....most probably u've forgotten da 'v r human beings'."
sarc,"the nice part. i'm surprised that you've even read the bible. presumably you're commenting on 1 thessalonians 5:2, wherein paul admonishes the greeks to be watchful for the coming of god? the funny thing is that all of my bibles say that."
sarc,you don't see me making similar knee-jerk reactions. woopdee fucking doo. but people should have a choice who they spend the rest of their life with. well done darling. but being an american you should know that in marriage people choose who they spend the next couple of years with not the rest of their lives. now let's get back to the facts - where in an arranged marriage does it say the 2 people getting arranged don't have a choice?
notsarc,"dear, as i have already said that rape is committed by persons of imbalance minds/or intoxicated persons. so, logically they can't exercise self control (and that's y we call them mentally imbalanced). i agree , that if a woman says no, it means no. but , in that state of mind a man can't understand that she is denying, what a rapist thinks is only his sexual gratification. and that's y its a crime . and we have punishments for it.. thank you for ur time. and i appreciate ur views.."
notsarc,"ez, can you cite an actual case where the aclu has intervened on behalf of nambla? the only person or persons with close associations to nambla that i can bring to mind is the notorious father paul r. shanley who molested countless children and was carefully sheltered under the wing of the notorious his eminence bernard francis cardinal law who was finally ousted from his cardinalship by a multitude of angry roman catholic parishioners in the boston area. dear his eminence bernard francis cardinal law was immediately taken and sheltered under the wing of the vatican and scooted over the pond to several administrative posts of the roman curia, where he was also named as archpriest of the basilica di santa maria maggiore, one of the five major basilicas of the roman catholic church."
notsarc,"that's just darling, and all. but it still doesn't indicate that a fetus is a small person. no one denies it's alive. no one denies it is of the species homo sapiens. no one denies that an embryo can ultimately become as person, which is the simplistic point of that cloying article. it is personhood of the fetus that is the debate. i don't think it can ever be definitively determined.  using dr. seuss was an excellent choice of reference to back your argument, however. i am not sure why you quoted shooter's post about a death sentence. however, if you really equate abortion with murder, are you willing to advocate charging the mother and doctor with premeditated murder?"
notsarc,oh really? i prove evidence to the subject and i don't repeat the same thing over and over again. i am not repeating anything over and over am i. i think you are the worst debator.
notsarc,oh really? this isnt cyber bullying. this is barely slander. you arent returning fire. this is stupid. freedom of speech isnt a two way street. you have restrictions. both legal and moral. what the hell is going on?
notsarc,"oh yeah, i went to see the new movie a couple of weeks ago, it's probably the most interesting film i have seen in a long time. i actually bought the book because of the movie and i am going to read it sometime in the near future. looking forward to it!"
notsarc,"okay, i guess i'll have to watch the new batman movies soon. what did you think of the opening scene to x2? with nightcrawler trying to assassinate the president? one of my favorite scenes from any movie. yeah, each spider-man movie was worse. last i heard, they are planning a complete reboot without tobey or raimi."
notsarc,"we do! on npr (which is our national public radio) they play the bbc world news daily. it is a fantastic source, i must agree."
notsarc,obama has 1 thing that palin certainly doesn't have is the fantastic ability to turn crowds in favor of him. obama has amazing speech abilities that surpasses palin without a doubt in my mind. palin also likes to go off subject almost as if she is avoiding certain questions.  what is experience if you cannot even thoroughly explain your position?
notsarc,"final, switzerland 1 spain 0. spain, one of the favorites or perhaps the favorite to win the world cup, loses to switzerland. what a shocker. of course with two more matches for all teams in this group anything can happen, but the pressure is on spain. they can not afford to lose another game, even a tie could mean not getting to the round of sixteen.emoticonxwow"
notsarc,"wow, it's really rare to see someone admit to changing their mind about an issue. definitely deserves an upvote."
notsarc,"my dear, i can see the wood for the trees. no-one expects perfect parents, but no parent should dictate school policy. and this guy was a bad example."
notsarc,i love when she reaches for that after wards; its like a hotel bed with 'magic fingers'. shakes the whole bed to help me get to sleep.
notsarc,"the argument has nothing to do with whether the bible is true or not, and everything to do with how certain concepts and interpretations are deduced from reading a piece of literature. i'm not arguing that i believe in a rapture, but rather that there is biblical support for a rapture event. i hope you see the difference"
notsarc,"i think that's an excellent question. since my area of expertise is chemistry and not climatology, i can only speculate that it's a combination of peer pressure, the desire to get funding and their allowing governments to manipulate their findings.  there have been several instances in which members of the ipcc have quit amidst claims that the final reports issued did not reflect their research. since the final ipcc reports are reviewed by politicians prior to being published, i'm not surprised with the claims made. here's a relevent story.

notsarc,"i love how you broke that down, but why would anyone who feels content in their life, by into something that's telling them they are wrong? it seems like they are cutting out a big portion of their market with a certain sin that harms no one."
notsarc,i am surprised that you would agree with the president of a group that says it promotes ' individual liberties to counter the radical right. '
notsarc,"proof? and, i'm just surprised that brooks is actually capable of seeing where the problem lies. his solution? probably another dumb republican non-solution."
notsarc,good u not lied in 1 yr ....good progress.....but till what time.....? life can show any moment at any time......no one knows about it....not lieing is good but sometimes your truth can kill or hurt someone dear.....
notsarc,"...and half right. preventing something that has been predicted does not create a paradox. your logic is severely flawed here. i'm somewhat surprised by that. if i predict that georgia tech will win the peach bowl and lsu comes up and prevents that, i still predicted it. i was just wrong. you are attaching something supernatural to nostradamus as if he really had some power to accurately predict the future. he made some lucky guesses...that's all. sometimes, the local fortune cookies are right, too. sometimes the horoscopes seem to fit. that doesn't mean that the writer's actually knew anything about their future readers."
notsarc,":d i love how no matter what we're talking about on createdebate, politics, and usually fox news, inevitably comes up. haha."
notsarc,"wikipedia is really quite amazing actually. you see the fact that anybody can modify it as a reason to not trust it. that would be a valid concern if it had only a small number of contributors. but, there are millions of contributors. each going over and correcting information supplied by others. in my mind (given the current number of users) wikipedia is a fantastic peer-reviewed source of information."
notsarc,"i don't :( tell me, inbox me if you don't want to say it in front of other's.  i am surprised i thought you would be to holy to have lust."
notsarc,insult? i'm not sure if you're joking or just have a bad memory. but you have been making false assumptions 'aka' insulting me also. i'm not trying to insult you. i'm simply dishing out just like you are buddy. and i don't have to back up anything to a stranger i'll never meet. i know how successful i am and what degrees i have. all these false assumptions you're coming up with aren't phasing me at all. stop dishing out if you cant take it.
notsarc,"that explains why your politician can work together i bet your current government is made of a collation ? in the uk parliament we still have a first past the post system where the party with the majority form the government.  it is slightly different in scotland we have a hybrid system of pr and first past the post, the politics in scotland has changed slightly in fact the executive is made up of a collation between two parties. this has the effect of making our politics more consensual where parties can actually discuss and negotiation solutions without party politics and vote scoring."
notsarc,"having been raised in texas as a child and teen, with many relatives still residing there, i'm surprised their educational system hasn't gone to the bible as its primary textbook. perhaps things have changed, but fundamentalist hypocrisy was at one time the law of the land in texas. maybe since texans are no longer served by oklahoma and louisiana bootleggers the fire and brimstone circuit has relaxed, but i'd find that difficult to believe as religion is a very effective control technique."
notsarc,"libertarianism emphasises freedom of the individual, and limited government. a stereotypical libertarian view would be for the legalisation of prostitution. that's why i am surprised."
notsarc,"i'm intrigued by that last tidbit there, infant baptism. can you please substantiate that with some scriptures?"
notsarc,"i am amazed you think al gore is lsong the debate last time i checked he has a global scientific consensus supporting his position, you know that means that the majority of the worlds scientists. http://www.skepticalscience.com/global-warming-scientific-consensus.htm "
notsarc,"dear chloe, do you really want women tried for murder because they decide to take a pill that will cause an abortion? that is the only logical position a court can take once a zygote, embryo and fetus are legislated into the status of human beings. if one kills a human being, one is guilty of murder."
notsarc,i think so too. every father should have a right to have a say when it comes to an abortion because that fetus was formed from their chromosomes and genetics. i am surprised that advocates for abortion are saying that men have no right to tell a woman how to control her body but yet they don't have a problem with the decision of the u.s supreme court in which all of the judges were men.
notsarc,"i'm a little surprised- i've found that pot smokers are usually the least pushy. usually they're laid back enough to just offer, unless they forget to offer. i've only ever been pressured to drink by one person, and that's all the peer pressure i've received. i'm not sure if it's the people i hang with, who almost all use something but are very laid back, or if it's that i'd be hard to ressure so that people don't try. what's your experience been?"
notsarc,your dispute seems like a very uneducated answer. does the wink mean that you're joking?
notsarc,'whose illegal war? america isn't even there to be at war anymore!' wow. please tell me you're joking?
notsarc,"Oh deary me, no. Where do I even start?The bacteria and enzymes in your gut and intestinal tract that digest food are every bit as microscopic, and they thrive on specific compounds, not elements. Sugars and fats are plain old carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. You could get exactly the same atoms into your body by drinking water and eating graphite - and you'd die. Can you digest cellulose? No - but other animals can, because they have enzymes that can break it down. It's still all just carbon, oxygen and hydrogen - but that's like saying everybody's front door key is just 'brass'. It isn't the fact that it's brass that unlocks your door, it's the shape it's formed into :) "
notsarc,"well, i own a new testament (only the new) book myself. so i am really surprised that you haven't seen one before.. but whatever. what i am saying, and what random dude seem to not get, is that christianity is based on the new testament. we believe in both books.. but when people ask, what is a christian? a christian is a person who believes in jesus - jesus only exist in the new testament - therefore if the new testament didn't exist, then christianity wouldn't exist either. so that is why christianity is based (remember the word based) on the gospels."
notsarc,"unkerpaulie, thank you for this explanation. boing! eureka! i have finally concretely grasped what a 'strawman' argument is. creating something that does not exist. making mock, in a sense. sorry, i just have to reiterate the term in my terms to paste it firmly into place in my cranium."
notsarc,"i was awake, just not on at the time you posted this. high school starts waaaayyy to early. anyway, i'm surprised at how many people post while i'm asleep (around 11:30 - 5:30 est)"
notsarc,"oh yeah, i don't disagree. i'm a massive fan of hitchens, and 99% of everything he said was true. he just happened to be, as you say, misguided on certain issues."
notsarc,"you're joking right? that's not even close. here's the verse just in case you read something else, i'll give you the benefit of the doubt with that: 1 corinthians 13:3: if i give away all i have, and if i deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, i gain nothing. this does not mean 'but not loved for it', but showing love."
notsarc,"oh really xaeon? netherlands has had prostitution legal for years and they are one of the most primary destinations for humans being trafficked. europe has many countries who have legalized prostitution but suffer from increased human trafficking. but maybe the us is different?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prostitution_in_the_netherlands  with it legalised more people are having sex with whores, and as soon as a whore is infected she doesn't even know it yet, so if she gets infected with hiv she still has sex with customers up until the day her next 'check up' is which is usually once a week. what happens to the infected prostitute? she gets kicked out onto the street. so thats one more woman infected, and possible many more men."
notsarc,"a drink. a drink. one or two. and what the hell does abstinence have to do with this? everything in moderation, yeah yeah. all that fun stuff. i get it. i wasn't talking about light drinking. i guess i should clarify but i thought you'd catch what i meant."
notsarc,"anyone who serves in the military is a hero. once you sign on the dotted line and take that oath, you are allowing for the possibility for death by combat at anytime. perhaps others didn't get the recognition she got, but that's not her fault. the media needed a 'darling of enduring freedom' poster child and she got picked."
notsarc,"i'm pro-choice because when i get pregnant, i want to chose whether or not i will abort it. i am not pro-abortion because i don't want to be forced to aborting my child when i get pregnant i am not pro-life, because i don't want to be forced to have my child when i get pregnant. i am pro-choice, do not call me pro-abortion, because that is not what i am. i don't go on the streets and say ''hey, let's all have abortions'' you on the other hand go on and say ''hey let's give all fetuses life'' that's what makes you pro-life. i don't want abortion. i wish no one would chose it because it would be much better without it. but the world isn't ideal. don't change the title, i just want people to know that we are called pro-choicers."
notsarc,"correct, of all the freedoms most dear is the right to be left to **** alone."
notsarc,"14 or 12... that is a ridiculous statement. drinking can affect the brain growth, and it goes through it most radical transformation at that age. oh yeah let's all stuff up the new generations brains and crap.. smart idea. if they were able to dink legally at that age it would encourage more to drink. many around that age aren't able to find alcohol really. it would make the situation worse than making it better.. the increase of binge drinking would also increase, it is at where it now because usually a person of that age, if they are able, cannot acquire a high amount of alcohol."

notsarc,"reminds me of the cold war clamor of necessary 'defense' nuclear weapon parity with russia. considering the threats we make directed towards iran and others along with our occupation of iraq, i'm surprised our conceit hasn't made all of me and asia scramble for nukes. pakistan, 97% muslim, hides bin laden, governed by a general constantly avoiding assassination attempts, never a bad word about that us 'ally'. but they have nukes and delivery systems. i'd think iran believes, as we've shown, that the us doesn't spew the democracy at the point of a gun policy to those nations possessing nuclear weapons."

notsarc,"simone darling, please stop. your making yourself look foolish. your trying to compare uniformed soldiers in an organized military under civilian gov't control to terrorists. there is no comparison to be made here, even you should be able to see that. huh? the u.s. military dismantled some of our bases in saudi arabia based on a prearranged schedule at the behest of the saudi government. it had nothing to do with 'capitulating to the taliban', nor did we remove all of our bases. yes simone, we still have military bases in saudi arabia."
notsarc,i agree with you dear... good reply of question... :)
notsarc,"this is why i'm tempted to say the us deserves to fail. this isn't a game. don't any of you ###### understand that the time for 'us vs them' is long gone? 'your' guy is not a god, and 'their' guy is not the devil. the whole divisive nature of the us is absolutely incredible. i'm sure i'm not alone when i look on in dumbfounded disbelief at some of the posts on here. you're nation is crumbling, and rather than trying to figure out the best way to save it, some are not-so-secretly hoping the government fails so they can say 'i told you so!' others seem to think as long as they insult the 'other team' enough, everthing will be a-ok. un-believable..."
notsarc,"winston dearie you really shouldn't make such general accusations, that can get you into trouble. point them out if you can. the shooting in norway, columbine, virginia tech, the tulsa shootings and the tuscon assassination attempt weren't carried out by people a normal person could consider decent and respectable in nature and they were all massacres. you might kill somebody too. you might kill a lot of somebodies for no reason. should you be legislated against and restrained?"
notsarc,"i'm nothing if not a thoughtful atheist, but it's not skepticism that drove me from religion, but revulsion, and i absolutely refuse to let fear, the lowest of emotions and religions favorite trump card, to have any sway over my life when it comes to determining my religious beliefs. fear of judgement day is just one more trick religion has to get us to submit, and while i'm not surprised it worked to control illiterate savages and barbarians thousands of years past, i'm astounded so many people in this day an age allow themselves to fall prey to pascals wager."
notsarc,"i can't vouch for what others believe. the creeds are a pretty accurate summary of my beliefs as regards who and what god is. the apostles' creed is the statement of belief used at baptism in most of christianity, so it would be strange for someone to have been baptised (or confirmed if they were baptised as an infant) without believing this to be true. to be honest i'm surprised by the idea that people (outside the pseudo-christian sects like the mormons and jehovah's witnesses) who claim to be christians would not believe what is stated in the creeds, it's not something that really occurred to me. i know that some people misunderstand the use of the word catholic in the last paragraph but that's about it."
notsarc,"i'm surprised that 'the sixth sense' didn't make anyone's list. the twist at the end totally caught me off guard and blew me away. i also like forest gump, slingblade, platoon, top gun, the wizard of oz, shawshank redemption. there are more but it's monday.... :p"
notsarc,"his lies, his media darling status, my post above answers your question for you."
notsarc,"i'm not sure how quotes from the other side of the same capitalist, warmongering coin as the republicans has any bearing on any church's support for war. the catholic church, and the us national council of churches (representing most protestant churches) opposed the war. the only church that was apparently in favour were the southern baptists, darling of the 'christian' right."
notsarc,"i think this is something everyone on here can get behind. at least i would hope so. saying that fred phelps is an embarrassment to this nation and my home state would be a gross understatement. sadly, i can't say i'm surprised by this, but i definitely don't think i would have ever predicted it. what he is doing is despicable. and what the patriot guard is doing is amazing. i like the sentiment involved in attempting to pass laws against protesting at funerals (although i don't know if they'll hold up in court), i only wish they had felt the same when he was protesting aids victims."
notsarc,"that's fantastic! i say you go for it, and... um... pics or it didn't happen."
notsarc,"why not invite a bunch of famous people? de niro is an incredibly interesting guy; my brother used to work on many films with him as a lighting specialist. he was one of the few folks that actually got to know him. scorsese, on the other hand, i'm sure, like you said, has tons of stories and anecdotes, all of which i'd love to hear! i've got my fair share of intellectual, spiritually magnificent people: ghandi, nietzsche and morello are all fantastic people."
notsarc,oh yeah. that is the one up-side of it. bleh! :p
notsarc,my goodness. i spoke to fast. :) i'll give you that one. i am shocked you even took the time to reply to my petty argument.
notsarc,"oh yeah, lets just say all the main people on comedy central."
notsarc,"actually, quite correct. i am surprised. i woudl have thought you more of the relativistic type."
notsarc,"for your answer to that, look at my argument about rehabilitation. oh yeah, i was just messin' around with that previous comment."
notsarc,"it's a pretty obvious counter question, i'm surprised it caught him so off guard. what's his name, if you don't mind my asking? i've got friends in illinois who would appreciate knowing about this, if they're in his district."
notsarc,"jitobear, i always love it when you post. you are succinct and to the point and i always wish i had said what you said."
notsarc,i'm surprised no one has mentioned this guy before now: http://epedia.pbworks.com/f/platypusc-2.jpeg

notsarc,"i'm a bit surprised at the publicity this case has attracted: even here in the uk, the first item on the 10 o' clock tv news last night was a report from outside the court house (waiting for the verdict). i've never heard jackson sing and know next to nothing about his career - why has this case made such a stir in the media ? is it just a fascination with 'celebrity' ?"
notsarc,"that explains it, post 60, page 4. look what comes up for me. i have my forums settings at 40 posts per page. post 121 which came up was the first post at the top of the page.  regarding ip's, the region/part of the country or world they are from can be determined, so i'll make you an additional offer; if he shows that both easyrider and my ip's are located in the same town in nh, i'll still agree to being banned. i say this not knowing where rider is from but i assume he doesn't live in my state."
notsarc,"as i recall the order of feet was left front foot, right hind foot, left hind foot, and finally right front foot. does that make you happy. oh yes the genes involved are known as peds and numbered in order 1-4. ped1 and ped4 are mirror images of each other (obtained by a process known as reflective copy) and ped2 and ped3 are much the same. this is of course entirely logical and could have been directed or random. the first critter to bear such feet was known as the ftse not to be confused with the index. its predecessors were of course the gimpy series since they had 1,2, or 3 feet and had to hobble along with what they had. ftse-1 is sometimes known as pogo because of its odd 'gait'."
notsarc,oh thanks i guess it was you who have been upvoting my arguements huh ? xd thanks!  allies ?
notsarc,http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releas...-chr053006.php but what does this have to do with the topic at hand?
notsarc,gitmo is a media darling. nobody talks about abu ghraib. and it is still in operation see what the obama admin thinks about closing that one. not a fucking word. enjoy the grandstanding.
notsarc,that's ...... well i'm not surprised really. have you ever watched 2 1/2 men? it's content is all about charlie's character's sex life.
notsarc,"1. you're kidding, right? have you never watched c-span and listened to congressional inquiries? it's all q&a;and fact driven. i haven't watched tv in quite a few years, and when i did i didn't watch c span.  where are the facts that the court has cited? 2. you have the chance to clear that up (about your denials) yourself. wouldn't i have to be in denial in the first place though?"
notsarc,"oh really?  science does not say 'we dont know x, y, z, but we want to know x, y, z, and so we observe x, y, z, and come up with our conclusions and claim it to be true, or not? (it's a question..) if scientists were too busy learning what is, then the science that is present now, would be non existent, because in order for science to learn and understand, it must be too busy learning and understanding what 'might be', or what it has not known, yet."
notsarc,"i am trying to become a going in to college for pre-med and i am shocked at the big decline in competion for such courses. not only has obamas healhcare programs overestimated the capability of our current amount of healthcare providers, but it is also deterring many from seeking such careers. by trying to help everyone in the short term, he is doing more damage to everyone in the long term."
notsarc,"that's not because of something i did. that's because of something that happened back in the 1950s, i believe. that's fine--go ahead and be offensive! it will only hamper your efforts because it only makes people angry at you when you belittle things they hold dear. but what about religious people that aren't out to do that to you and your family? if the govt. endorses a religion, remove the endorsement! that's fine. you're still willing to be offensive to all religious people because of fundamentalists (which are really the ones doing what you describe!). you can be as offensive and show as much lack of respect as you want. it's only going to make it harder on you to convince people."
notsarc,oh yeah everytime you downvote someone you lose points so if you don't have that many you go into the negative.
notsarc,"i'm pretty sure you're joking... but still, if one has the power to acquire and manipulate knowledge sufficiently well, then one can learn to protect himself from bombs and such. my house was recently afflicted by ants. massive amounts of ants. yet their numbers did not amount to much after the strategic placement of a few of these."
notsarc,"i'm surprised that you disagree, seeing as how you've seen the hills have eyes. i'd say hills have eyes was one of the more disturbing films."
notsarc,"as an outside observer, these are my thoughts too. it's plain selfish and stubborn as far as i'm concerned, i'm surprised that the democratic party itself isn't stepping in, maybe they are behind the scenes. waxy"
notsarc,i'm very surprised to learn that religious institutions are exempt from the normal taxation associated with having employees.
notsarc,"no dear! how can we foget about the people who have opened the old age homes for those whose sons have left them? those are real humans!see, we cannot be so pessimistic to look at the negative side,even if the real humans are surrounding us, the brightness of sun cannot be hidden by the patches of clouds"
notsarc,personally i can't stand it when someone uses 'lol'. it's usually used derisively when politeness suggests that leaving it out and responding politely is in order. personally i'm surprised at this thread. the author apparently didn't read the faq.
notsarc,"dont begin to understand real love till 18 or older i felt real love when i was 13, and i was with that woman i loved for years. saying someone can't effectively do something until they reach a certain age is ridiculous; turning a certain age doesn't magically make you any wiser nor dumber."
notsarc,"find me a spell check plugin for firefox liminus. i had one for ie before i switched over.  frankly, i'm not surprised we're going to use that for police and military applications."
notsarc,the word of easy's god is evil! that explains a morally bankrupt lot.
notsarc,"considering the dumbocrats have held the house (which initiates spending bills) for most of that time, then you have nothing but more hot air. oh yes he does. he'll let them get the bomb, knowing they want to wipe out israel. not very bright of him. is he an anti-semite?"
notsarc,"i love how every line, except number 3, has a winking emoticon at the end. haha"
notsarc,"well, i can't say that i'm surprised. just another politician for ya. they're all the same."
notsarc,"i just love how you call it a baby and not 'contents of the uterus' or 'product of conception' or 'fetus'. the truth is, that was a child."
notsarc,"theres no scientific studies that disproves nor supports them. so i guess yes, its 50/50 so more or less half of these are likely to exist right? every imaginary thing that i could make up, half of that is probable to existing if they all can't be proven or disproven?"
notsarc,"you calling me a diseased freak ?  oh , darling . thats okay . we will forever and ever be married . but now you have to buy me a new pillow"
notsarc,"no one believes this. this is a non-issue. i'm not surprised you would respond that way jyoshu. you don't take these issues seriously at all. thus you can have a good laugh, and be sarcastic and think you are witty. in reality, it shows how clueless you are in terms of gay issues. 'the equality-obsessed modern gay pride movement'? gays don't have equality, and therefore there is a movement for that. i don't think anyone is obsessed with equality. i could just as quickly say there is an obsession with keeping gays in an unequal status."
notsarc,"well...., i hope you're kidding because i don't think that's a fair assessment."
notsarc,"lol, what did you mean by that? i'm not sure, and dont want to assume the tone you infer with. i thought it was funny but wanted to clarify. ps; i have never called anyone a 'fetus worshiper', although at least that label does not elicit the same evil connotations 'pr-abortion does'. @ simone, no worries hun :)"
notsarc,"dear thetruth, i have posted it as a serious topic. and of course it is meant to get people talking, thinking and arguing. if you were watching/listening to the trump press conference that obama brink into the middle of (beceause he was getting slaughtered), you would take this seriously. btw, on may 23rd (the day after he finisheds the last apprentice show), we can expect some announcement! what it will be i don't know, but i bet it will be trump confirming he will run for president. andy"
notsarc,"i'm not surprised. i have more than that, i also have common sense on my side. firearms don't facilitate killing, firearms facilitate keeping criminals from getting a corner market on domination. the police are outnumbered by the criminals, the criminals are outnumbered by the law-abiding citizens. we shouldn't be unarmed when we're the majority force in maintaining the balance. too bad."
notsarc,"oh yeah... that... well... but what a sweet way to go, right ;)"
notsarc,"wow... you are bent on harping on creationists arguments at whatever the cost.first of all, you are not even considering that the majority of people are misinformed of what evolution is not because they have creationist motives, but because they go to the dictionary for definitions "
notsarc,"you know, i'm astonished at the fact that during an osce conference on combating discrimination and promoting mutual respect and understanding that took place in bucharest early in june, the attendees discussed all sort of things except the flagrant current situation in poland  this country gains the lead among european countries in violation of human rights in terms of anti-semitism, racism, hatred to moslems, xenophobia, homophobia, and discrimination against hiv-positive persons. this fact was evinced in poland's country report on human rights practices-2006 released by us department bureau of democracy, human rights, and labor. here i present you part of the report that has relevance to the subject. to put it short, there are quite a lot of people in poland who suffer persecution  jews, non-europeans (arabs, moslems, africans, roma), persons of alternative sexuality and hiv-positive persons."
notsarc,"i'm not surprised. we're living in an age when communication outside of our local group is becoming increasingly common. people are starting to hear ideas they never would have before. religion has generally survived because people's experiences were limited to the views of those immediately around them, those who pretty much shared those same views. today, and for a while now, that's been changing and people are hearing other things causing them to rethink what they've been taught."
notsarc,"i'm not really surprised at the bush administrations lack of a forest management plan. he known for not being an enviromentally-friendly president. forest fires are usually a natural occurance. they are often good for the eco-systems.it's the man made disasters that are the problem. we can't stop forest fires, but we can keep the property damage to a minimum by thining forests, building access roads where posible to fight the fires, and have stricter control over timber harvests. often the timber companies over-cut certain areas, leaving the lanscape a barren, lifeless terrain, not suited for wildlife habitat. soil erosion can become a problem also, as the silt from the soil erosion pollutes the streams and damages the fish habitat. the government needs a good forest management plan for public lands, and more funding for personel to impliment the current programs of forest management."
notsarc,"he was a partial-birth abortion provider that killed babies late term. in terms of fetal viability he might as well been killing babies right after they'd been born. i don't condone it, but i'm surprised it didn't happen sooner--one monster killed by another. it wasn't right, but what that sicko doctor was doing was certainly no better."
notsarc,"well, i'm not surprised. the left coast rarely gets anything right. :)  btw, gm still has over 25% of the domestic vehicle market and it didn't get it by selling econoboxes like the japanese did."
notsarc,"as compared to how they would be during a period of instability? i said they were internally stable so we agree here, ahem. also the us is not unstable as far as external physical forces are to us. economic forces you could make a point but not the extent that everyone is declaring sanctions against us. that is what north korea is basically doing only it is a physical force that is building against them. the us has no external threat against them at this time that is as threatening as what north korea is facing and that is because the us is far more externally stable than north korea is. i'm not surprised that you declare the us evil for causing instability but give it no credit for creating this stability that we have been focused on."
notsarc,"ohhh, okay. well, i guess since i don't know, i can't answer that question. i don't really know if i believe. i haven't been given a reason too, but i'm not set in that state of mind, and i acknowledge the potential and likelihood for god to exist.  i'm in the middle.  it's sort of like this (in terms of belief in god):  atheist-------------------agnostic----------------------christian "
notsarc,"money cant fix your problems at all you think that they can but they cant. i think that it can because money has fixed all of my problems.  come on! give me an answer to what can't money fix? leys say your one of those people that would die. how would you feel. i would feel however i was feeling before i died. in the debates hypothetical i wouldn't even know that i was going to die. many things are wrong with killing why cant you see that? wow! there are many things? to back up your assertion, list 5 of these things for me."
notsarc,"i'm referring to chemist's assertion that mutations cause a beneficial modification to the morphology of hemoglobin. my two links say the hemoglobin becomes 'abnormal,' thus his example fails.  and you are assuming that this mutation is random. why? cancer mutations are not random...they are lead up to by epigenetic changes. why not this? http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releas...-nvo122105.php"
notsarc,you're kidding me? after all that i just told you and altarion even blocked you from posting messages onto his profile you still try to pull this shit?! how disgraceful of you! >:( this is some low shit you pulled! now i'm telling you: stay away from him!
notsarc,"not that i was interested in joining them, but i did read the two links. i'm not much surprised that science has nothing to do with it...and not at all surprised that many actors are into it...hollywood has long been known to generate kooks. i suppose they are just a small portion of the total, but they are very publicized."
notsarc,i'm surprised that they still have that on their website after bellesiles was proven to be a fraud. what do you mean by the dates?
notsarc,"baby, i am going to publicly say that if it wasn't for you i would be so out of here . oh yeah and for merlin too"
notsarc,"i didn't know that, but i'm not surprised by it. israel needs all the soldiers it can get.  and i disagree with you on the iran war issue. all out war with iran will have the israelis sitting on the sidelines yet again so as not to xxxx off the me allies fighting against iran."
notsarc,"thanks for that, jason. in esdraelon's defense, there are hundreds of authors of other religions who choose to take portions of our writ out of context, and morph them into something that looks like what he described. (a self-made god who has an alotted portion of the universe.) this is not the actual belief of lds. this is a skewed and exaggerated oversimplification of our doctrine of eternal progression. it's also what seems to be most commonly understood when an lds tries to briefly explain the doctrine.  in other words, i'm not surprised that esdraelon was under that impression."
notsarc,"it is not appropriate on this site to call people names. i understand that you are still learning in school and are busy, but i think that they taught basic spelling and grammar at a much early age than 16, so there is really no excuse! i did take the time to google your school, but you are too young to realize that maybe this is not the only coolidge hs in the country... so i went with the first google result... i am not impressed, the school gets a 4 out of 10 and 3 out of 5 stars from parents!"
notsarc,"you mean 'junk dna' ? i think it's more than 20%, more like 95% http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/junk_dna http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releas...-jdy052804.php http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99995063 i don't think that's what the poster was referring to, i really think he/she was ignorant of what scientists really know. basically, the fact that its there points me in the direction of evolution. also the fact that there are conserved regions of dna within codons and exons points me toward evolution as the explanation. oh, now i see! of course they know what their own acronym stands for. they also know why they named the bases a (adenine) g (guanine) t (thymine) c (cytosine) u (uracil). they named them when they were discovered. i think the poster was saying they don't know how they work, which is quite false. of course, the mechanism of protein transcription has been known for quite some time."
notsarc,"i don't think i am shocked, i am scared! lol"
notsarc,does the pacific ocean truly 'exist' ? oh yeah 3000! time to celebrate!
notsarc,"this has nothing to do with my post. you don't need to believe in conspiracy theories to believe that the universe is pretty crazy. i'm an advocate of science, and even i admit that, especially at the quantum level, shit gets crazy. particles being in two places at once, 95% of the universe being undetectable, whole separate universes colliding to make new ones. it's crazy yes, but it is also scientific. in fact, compared to science, the answers psychics provide are rather boring. i'm impressed by the stuff i just listed, not some charlatan guessing whether or not i have a dog."
notsarc,"i'm going to presume that you are a christian. why are you a christian? because you happened to have been brought up in a christian family. why aren't you a hindu? because you weren't born in india. if you were born in india, you'd be a hindu. if you were born in central africa, you'd be believing in strange mountain gods.  use your brain, however reassuring and pleasant it is, god does not exist.  oh yeah, and why won't god heal amputees?"
notsarc,"oh yeah, i forgot that you believe that the corporate media and corporate leaders have gotten together to create war and put innocents in jail. i will admit that the powers of the executive branch have gone way too far, but i still believe that being at war means we have to treat the enemy like our enemy, and not like american civilians. do i agree with the war? no. but that's only because i feel that we could have done this all with special forces and not with an invasion/occupation. i would still support detaining terrorists captured in battle/mission (and if they're americans, give them a proper trial, not a military tribunal or some bullshit like that)."
notsarc,humans don't just have sex for procreation. humans have sex for pleasure. that explains the evolution of the clitoris and the bundle of nerves underneath the head of the penis.
notsarc,"hello my dear!  what do you think people should live in a peaceful world?  as you know george washington is cruel man who did a lot of bad things in order to be success, to get high position? you know that a lot of people died from washington? most people from iran and irak suffered more distress and you can not imanige that situation. what about the twin towers? maybe you think that that accident was by muslin people? no, it was not! of course washington did it in order to substitute muslim men"
notsarc,i'm always amazed at how women can do stuff with their bodies that make my body react ;)

notsarc,"oh yeah! i remember that one... abbynestor was going off on everyone, so i told to to calm down and then everyone (including the people she was ripping on) starting yelling and calling me a dick.  like honestly dana got called a bunch of nasty stuff, i try to defend her and she gets snappy with me...like what? that's why i'm going to stay away from that stuff now."
notsarc,"agreed. god does exist in some form, whether you want to call god a supreme being or whatever, there is a greater power out there thats beyond our comprehension. in the meantime lets all just get along"
notsarc,you never played myst? damn!!! i must be really old ;)
notsarc,freedom dearie are you serious about pepper spray? just yesterday i presented a story where a taser and bean bag rounds from a shotgun did literally nothing against a 68 year old with a bad heart condition. what can a cheap chemical agent do against an adrenaline charged youth who's got more vitality and health on his side than a senior citizen in new york?

notsarc,"hello there, my dear fellow, you're using a 19th century definition for a 21st century subject. it doesn't work. what you're writing is pure drivel. there is the caucasian group which you initially mention, then you misuse the terminology, actually meaning the sub-ethnicities of the caucasians. no doubt you're one of those sadly misinformed individuals who believes that 'muslim' is a race. the state of education is surely at an all time low-and getting lower no doubt. cheers from the rockies emoticonxkill emoticonxhoho emoticonxcry emoticonxkill"

notsarc,"i'm not 100% sure what set of facts you are working from, but they are not the correct ones i assure you. way more jewish people were killed than died in the iraq war. when you add everyone killed in wwii iraq is not even a comparison. let me make it clear, i'm debating the lesser of two evils here, (speaking of the war, i'm not for the assassination of bush. you can't kill someone for being an idiot, if so kill everyone who elected him, not just him... which would be more people than wwii and iraq war combined by the way)... where was i? oh yeah, there's no comparison. it's an evil (though crazy) ass who caused millions upon millions to die, vs. spoiled governor's son way too dumb for his position listening to douchebags like dick."
notsarc,i'm sure i will get bored with the site long before 13000 points. lol! i'm surprised he hasn't.
notsarc,"wow, thats pretty cool, not that i can afford it or anything. and i doubt it will be as common as the regular car is.  i'm serious about the broccoli though, you would think with all the amazing technology on this planet we could find a way to make healthy food taste good. instead we are making unhealthy food taste like crap.  think about it, broccoli is one of the most healthy foods on the planet, if you ate a full serving of broccoli every day it would increase your longevity by years. now imagine if it tasted just like hershey's milk chocolate."
notsarc,"allright, well then i think it's odd too, arians would have made more sense. i'm surprised they are considered obscure, the council of nicea is historically considered one of the defining moments of the early christian church, and the arian controvery was it's main event. for the record, they were discussed in my high school, that's why i was making sure."
notsarc,"first off, i love how you celebrated america's birthday in alaska with mexican food. lol. also, why 1am? what time does the sun set there? i know it's late, but how late? i went to holland in june 2003 and the sun was up well after 10. it was amazing."
notsarc,"i'm not in the least surprised.. i stated that it was required by law.. i never said anything about when it became a requirement. as of now, in the year 2010 applying for a ss number is required.. would you say that is an invasion of privacy?..  and for your information clinton wasn't the first or last president to rape the social security program.. politicians have been using it as a personal bank for decades."
notsarc,"if i may hijack this thread (sad to do so as i love seeing people criticise bush), i'm intrigued by this idea that deindustrialisation is a bad idea. if it is, then most of the world is doomed to live in povety surely? there is only a finite manufacturing capacity within the word and it is far less than the total number of jobs required throughout the world. we have to be able to have countries that are heavily reliant upon service based jobs. are you sugegsting that this cannot work in the long term?"
notsarc,i'm surprised i agree with you on this. the only point i'd add is that the force feeding should only be used while the person is undergoing therapy to fix the underlying problems.
notsarc,"the 9/11 commission omits the presence of molten steel from their official report. the 9/11 commission omitted it because...??? what is this deep dark secret they don't want the american public to know? which, according to you is easily figured out anyway. 'we could blow up a u.s. ship in guantanamo bay... omg. couple of cia guys brainstorming for solutions to a problem and people go nuts. if that's the worst of what they contemplated...i'm not impressed.  i'm sure conspiracies happen all the time but they are so rare as to be insignifigant. my wife and i can't even agree on a restaurant."
notsarc,"so in what way are the sperm and egg not human pray tell? are your sperm/eggs from some other species? are they lizard life? elephant life? what kind of life do they have (and you admit they do) outside of human life? sorry but sperm and egg are human and they are alive, how can you deny both statuses? oh yes if both sperm and egg are living matter then the claim 'life begins at conception' is patently false. i will assume you modify that phrase now to be 'human life begins at conception' but that is also clearly false on the face of it."
notsarc,"oh yes, president obama also has to figure out how to get rid of the bush policy of lies and falseness bush people burrowed into the federal government by bush during his last days as president in order to thwart the spread of science, research and reality."
notsarc,haha i don't hate him! he added me as an enemy! :p i was shocked when he did! haha
notsarc,"okay, at least you gave an example for reagan. i personally think the russians were on the decline long before the end of the cold war, and reagan happened to be president when they finally fell, but we can agree to disagree. for bush i hope you're joking, because it has been quite clear that his policies have more than likely created more terrorists than he has helped defeat (not to mention the numerous other bad things he's done as president). in fact the only really good thing that came out of bush's presidency was that his unpopularity paved the way for obama to become president."
notsarc,"as we've seen in recent years, kids who are bullied can become so anti-social that they become violent, and attack those who've bullied them with weapons and mass murders. i'm not condoning this behavior, but i'm not surprised that it happens. those who support the bullying of gay kids and others...well, you get what you sow."
notsarc,"i think in the mind of a psychopath with boundary issues, what the woman was wearing, or where she was at does not matter at all. how do you explain people who get raped in their homes? how about people who aren't dressing slutty, they're just having a drink with a friend, but that friend turns out to have a darkside? i really hope you're joking though."
notsarc,"i noticed..., you got a public apology. i'm impressed ;)"
notsarc,"quiet the opposite. fossil records give us a snap shoct of location in time going way back. molecular biology, geology, radiography do so as well. where do you get the idea that there is no evidence? everything we have in our heads is what has been taught to us. shoulder's of giants, hun. it is observed. you and i have about one hundred non fatal mutations in our genotype. remember, most mutations are innocuous. not so. only one of a pathogenetic organism needs this and as mutation is pretty common in rappid generation organisms (bacteria) situations the 'chances' are very much in favour of it happening. remember, mutations are happening to every bacteria every generation at random."
notsarc,i'm totally surprised i've posted so many posts in this thread: not like me at all.
notsarc,i lived in sevilla for the better part of year. spaniards are extremely good at staying out of other people's business. smiling at a stranger on the bus is invasive. i am not surprised most spaniards support gay marriage - most likely because they would never assume it was any of their business.
notsarc,"i'm a little surprised by this. the polls i've seen show that mass voters favor gay marriage. i would have thought that getting those who oppose it to put their opposition on the record before the elections would be beneficial. then again, seeing as how the lies and fear mongering have already started, i can see how they might want to avoid having the elections muddied with the inevitable dirty fighting that would be thrown at them. not the most couragous stance, but perhaps safer in the long run. you are right that the longer society fails to collapse the more inane the doomsayers seem."
notsarc,oh yeah. the things i do for fun just ruin my appetite. i like to look at bacteria under a couple of microscopes i have. sometimes i just place random bacteria together to see how they react. usually they dont do anything. if you do have questions don't be afraid to ask.
notsarc,"i'm surprised at the density of posters still attempting to tie zarqawi to saddam's government or (prior to us occupation resistance) al qaeda. his actions in iraq prior to the us invasion were limited to kurdish territory, where saddam was attempting to contain that rebellion, and zarqawi was never a disciple of bin laden. zarqawi's bio has been reviewed on the internet many, many times: http://www.weeklystandard.com/conten...4/094npvzg.asp as to al qaeda training camps in saudi arabia, they do exist in spite of publicized saud government attempts to eliminate them. even the most naive poster with even a minute understanding of the saud steel grip on their nation should be able to comprehend that if the sauds didn't want something, it wouldn't be there. and need i mention pakistan? http://www.wtnh.com/global/story.asp?s=1381324 http://www.nationalreview.com/commen...0402090859.asp"
notsarc,heh. i'm amused that we both put 'massage' in quotes.
notsarc,"that's pretty funny, the last two posts that is. that's actually interesting that the term started that way. i'm surprised that no one had coined a term before that though."
notsarc,"finally an other conservative in this site. i mean who do these people think they are? trying to pass amendments like the fairness act. but i'm not surprised that some order is coming back to are leaders. when the government swings to far to one side, (in this case left) its ganna swing back to the other side, we just as conservatives, need to make sure we don't go to right, or we'll have done just as bad as the liberals."
notsarc,"hun dont let no ones opinions bother you. no one matters but you, because your living your life and its your body. i personally think everyone shold hold off till 16 but im not going to insult you because thats just plain retarded. what gives you people the right to insult someone for asking a question? im not talking about freedom of speech im talking about being a nice person. nobody has manners anymore, i swear."
notsarc,"this man has a valid point. but i guess the people he mentions, the extremists and the racists will overlook his wisdom because that's the way they work."
notsarc,"i'll check it out, if in thirty seconds i'm not impressed you'll have my answer."

notsarc,mexico? that explains many things. mexico: candidates must address murders of women | human rights watch
notsarc,wow i didn't know you were going to calculate that! well its true i do earn a lot of points a day and join and participate in a lot of debates in a day. also my 2nd year being here is coming up soon!
notsarc,"i agree. hence why we need to evict the gop from the congress today it is evident by the liberal history of the gop majority that they cannot be trusted with money, with the size of government, with foreign relations, with underage pages, with the military in general, with privacy, civil rights or even the most basic function of congress: oversight.  liberalism needs to be evicted from congress, therefore the republicans need to go.  it never stopped bothering me that more democrats voted aganist the schavio bill then republicans. democrats more conservative then republicans? well..given how far republicans have gone over i can't say i'm surprised."
notsarc,"yeah, that was all just exaggeration and absurdities from religionist to make the story more fantastic and supernatural. or else nobody will ever join them religion."
notsarc,"i'm surprised, maybe your area of the uk is different, but in mine nearly all atheists are hereditary, or they just break away from the religions of their parents because they dislike their parents instead of the religion."
notsarc,spam such as this: http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/technologies_is_fantastic_for_metal_signs_but_is_it_good_or_bad_for_client_service this one is quite common: http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/                                       point_of_sale_systems_how_to_choose_a_single_that_is_correct_for_your_company
notsarc,"wow. just because people believe in god or claim so does not mean they have or use god as their moral compass. the god, i assume we are talking about the christian god, does not promote war and if we are to actualy follow what this god teaches and use god as our moral compass we would not go to war, but most people do not follow god as their moral compass and thus do go to war."
notsarc,"my dear; sweetie; (and any other ridiculous and intentionally patronizing words you regularly use) i don't support the gop. i think both parties are corrupt. you on the other hand, seem to have sold your soul to the dnc a long time ago."
notsarc,"i do agree. the rot started here when thatcher came to power, and became chronic when neil kinnock became leader of the labour party. now we have two parties in hock to corporate interests, and even if another party did get elected, their hands are tied because of the reaction of the financial markets. the actions of the ecb in bailing out hedge funds is a sign of how bad it has got. i think we'd best not discuss the solution otherwise we'll start to disagree again. :p george monbiot has the beginnings of a plan in his book age of consent. i'm quite surprised you agree with what is an essentially marxist analysis of the situation though."
notsarc,"economic understanding does not come from a series of graphs and equations that come from a man who has no understanding of how humans work. the economy is not some mechanical machine, it is an organic mass of all 7 billion people of the world making millions decisions every day. behind all the smoke and mirrors, all this man said was this, in other words, concluded bullshit is still bullshit.  and your second point, companies also compete on a technological level, if they aren't as advanced as their competitors they generally go out of business because people want the better quality/cheaper product. what is the states incentive? getting re-elected? oh wait, thats easy to do when 95% of voters have no clue as to what is going on and only think about politics for 5 minutes during the elections."
notsarc,the majority of women that are of child bearing age will already have at least one child. i'm not surprised at all by this statistic - its what you'd expect it to be.
notsarc,"wow, 'stupid, selfish, anti-american'  i'm guessing you have something to back up such bold statements? or are you just talking out of your ass again?"
notsarc,"darling, you're too sensitive. i've never had an issue with your debates. it was a parody of some of the new ones out. you've probably seen them, they ask a question then give yes, because and no, because for the answers when they are clearly not a question that can be answered yes or no. if i had a problem with yours, i'd be enough of a friend to kindly point it out. again, you're cool with me, don't worry.edit: i see where you've seen what i was referring to. it's early here and i'm not yet awake. but i have to get crank-started and get ready for class."
notsarc,"he'll get to you eventually, he's doing them in order of points. lol though i'm disappointed to say that a lot of people, including myself, are starting to lose interest in the roasts. i'm not surprised though, because there's a lot of inactive users."
notsarc,"i would never limit myself in a debate to 'how many' generations it takes because the fact is your scientists are afraid to test such things. in the following example it took between 7 and 18 generations for guppies to change their phenotypes. http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releas...sss-270397.php of course these guys, being evolutionsts explain this phenomenon as happening through natural selection -- death. but what have we already learned about tadpoles?? -- they develop in direct relation to their predators....including body structure. fish are no different."
notsarc,"do away with scholarships, too. oh yes. humans have a natural desire to learn. are ever learning.  besides, you don't need two to three years to prepare for these exams, nor do you need a public high school to help you prepare for them. teachers must assess all the time in order to teach. the issue there is not grades, but assessment. the appropriate methods varying, for different teachers. you believe that, because you don't know anything else."
notsarc,"i guess that you didn't look at my last link. there are recalls every year that effect millions of cars, and those companies are not being bullied by the government. the point is every car company has recalls, and the government is targeting toyota. ford, gm, buick all have recalls. why are they not targeted? so, the government is the almighty paternalistic big brother punishing those bad and irresponsible companies who only care about themselves and wreck endless destruction to society and the environment. no, toyota is committed to fixing faulty accelerator only because of accusations for causing accidents."
notsarc,"quote from simone 'and, being forced to carry to term and give birth to the spawn of a rapist compounds the harm of the rape many times over.' have you thought about therapy darling ?"
notsarc,very much so i am surprised. i'm usually a totally cynical realist.
notsarc,why debate man ... lets all be friends         agreed with 20/20
notsarc,"for someone who puts importance on the ability to think i'm surprised that you believe mentally handicapped people are as valuable as the average person. value is of course the key word here. value can be interpreted to mean many different things including value to the human society. even the humanistic perspective has to take into account that the human society as a whole even if it is only a small portion. i don't think the handicapped can hold a great deal of value in the human society when compared to the avereage 'intelligent and able-bodied humans', wouldn't you agree? if so then where do they make up for this imperfection to increase their 'value' to be equal to that of an able-bodied human?"
notsarc,"i'm not surprised you would say this. it is the statement of a person who would want power and control over a woman's womb, which, btw, inoygdb."
notsarc,"marriage is social support. the government, in supporting marriage, is giving social support to certain relationships covered by marriage.  you argue marriage should be left up to the culture institutions such as churches, government should only do the paper work. that's an acknowledgment of the current social role of government recognized marriage. you don't want government to provide that social support, suddenly, now that it will include gays. oh yes, it speaks to the cultural relevence of government-recognized marriage. people would not feel sufficiently compelled to change the constitution over a matter of meaningless government paperwork which has no social relevence."
notsarc,"i'm not disputing the numbers, and i'm certainly not disputing the fact that bush won.  what i'm intrigued about is the razor thin margins, to my mind anyway, that characterize the us election system. don't you find it the least bit odd that it's been 30 years since a president received a plurality? waxy"
notsarc,"fair enough. i tend to run skeptic. i am surprised that i am a theist. if you were to believe in a god, which would it be?"
notsarc,"..... yeah i guess so, if you're willing to prescribe them the property of an independent 'human being'."
notsarc,"oh yes, the rhubarb is one of my favorites too. a fine choice..you get a cake emoticonxbirthdaycake"
notsarc,"ya it's true, it was pretty hilarious. i'm just surprised he only got 7 days and a $1,000 fine. it is only single a minor leagues, but that was rediculous."
notsarc,"i really hope you're joking. extremism is a disease, but not religion. religion can be, and is, for the most part, peaceful."
notsarc,"[quote=matthew s]xxxxx as folk all the way. too bad it has ended :( i loved the show boston common when it was on. quote] qaf was awsome. the l word is good too, but it seems to have a high turnover in it's cast. boston common was wonderful. the guy from yes, dear is in it and he is so funny."
notsarc,"my parents moved to shawnee not long ago. when i was a kid, anything west of lenexa was considered too close to desoto, and a little suspect :) i was up that way not long ago, and even deoto is fairly respectable now :) :)  i am surprised there are so many here from kansas. there is somebody here from lenexa as well."
notsarc,"oh yes we can. invoking god is not an explanation for ultimate origins, it's the papering over of the absence of an explanation by declaring further application of the question off limits. simply declaring that god's origin doesn't need explaining does not make that so."
notsarc,"i love that you guys dont seem to be joking when you talk about it being offensive to gays - if anything i would think only tom cruise would find it offensive - because of his claims that he isnt gay (obviously untrue) gays would probably cheer if he (along with his penis) would come out of the closet if someone would find this offensive, it wouldnt be me vs gay guys - it would be me vs overly sensitive and selfrighteous guys who happen to be gay"
notsarc,wow what an awkward discussion. there is obviously no reason to sterilize when they are sexually retarded as opposed to mentally retarded and even then mentally retarded can have non mentally retarded children and some of them are able to take care of their offspring depending up the severity of their condition.
notsarc,"you wouldn't be a commodity at all if you weren't willing to sell, you'll be hunted though. i guess you could rent out your labor for a time if you somehow didn't get hunted and weren't willing to sell your genetic material."
notsarc,"wow :) i'm just a starter, that's my first big tattoo (the debate picture, sorry about the glare, i had another sitting friday and it was lathered in tattoo goo!) i've had 5 hours on it so far, still got so long left but it's going to be a 3/4 sleeve once finished."
notsarc,Well that explains your anger.:p I hope you are blessed with homeliness.:) Makes your commitment easier to keep. How old are you now? 
notsarc,"yeah even i have to agree you were making a joke. i may not agree with your stances on things, but i can see when you're joking."
notsarc,"i'm in total agreement with that statement. unfortunately, parents are passing that mindset on to their children. the us experienced a decline in college enrollment in 2005, which speaks volumes about us lower education and personal motivation, at the very time other nations have accelerated their production of graduates in science and engineering. we'll end up paying a dear economic price for that circumstance.  on the bright side, we have a large surplus of business majors to manage our service industry, the down side being their lack of basic reading and writing skills."
notsarc,"to be honest with you, i'm mildly amused at best."
notsarc,"really? wow! my parents did the same thing! we had a water-cooler bottle that my dad put change into for years, and when we were little kids we went to cash it in, all of us helping to roll the hundreds of pounds of coins, and it ended up being worth over $900! ever since then, i've been a coin fanatic. people are so quick to throw away change. my friends know that i'll always take a nickel or a few pennies if they don't want to carry them around."
notsarc,"gay dreams are pretty common among men, but it doesn't make them gay erm.. you've had dreams about having sex with men? i think you're kidding yourself if you think that's normal for a straight guy."
notsarc,"that is a poor argument. if you want to become better at debate, in general, don't make statements you cannot back up, but never say that your using 'what i've been told' as an argument. your opposition will tear you apart. :)  lol, it's not like i care that much for this debate, but i will take that into consideration :) i am impressed with your willingness to debate any topic with an open mind compared to many others i have seen on this site and would enjoy debating you in a more formal structure. if you agree, of course. thank you, and of course. i'd love to debate with you."

notsarc,"i guess this disease is 'contagious' thus due to this contagious disease it can spread rapidly. if he dies then no one gets infected and vice versa. although, i believe that if that is the situation i don't the infected persons opinion matters. if you possibly may kill even 1 person you will probably be isolated from social world and be taken to a place where you have no contact with the public no questions asked."
notsarc,"@ raastee: i've glanced through your paper: i'm surprised you were allowed to get away with the sentence, 'irrationalism is a fallacy to be avoided'. irrationalism is not a fallacy: a fallacy is an apparently genuine but really an illogical argument. irrationalism, outside number theory, is merely a discourse or statement inconsistent with the use of reason."
notsarc,wow. i can't believe they block it. it's not like facebook or porn. it's actually educational (sort of.) haha
notsarc,i love how hamas apologists require showing idf abuses to defend their actions. pathetic.
notsarc,oh yeah i said that because what he said was a sweeping statement and i was just pointing out what he posted is not always the case.
notsarc,why weren't you on createdebate lately ??? and after reading the book you will be :o the book is fantastic ...happy reading :)
notsarc,"seriously man, i hope you don't believe what they tell you on that channel. it's just whoa. this one anchor woman was talking about how background checks led to registration than extermination; i was shocked. the thing with fox is, they put on whatever rupert murdoch wants."
notsarc,i am really surprised this one got so many upvotes :p
notsarc,"i love how he says 'war of terror' not 'war on terror' and everyone claps. thanks for the clip, it's been awhile since i've seen that one. people don't realize but that unbridled rage and nationalism is what led to the rise of hitler and the holocaust as well as pretty much every genocide and war. 'you'll never have a quiet world till you knock the patriotism out of the human race. ' - george bernard shaw"
notsarc,"it depends on what kind of faith you are talking about. do you mean 'having faith' in actual things? if so, then most definately. although the world can sometimes be a cruel and horrible place, it can also be a fantastic one, and seeing that (as i'm an athiest) gives me some kind of 'faith' in the human capacity, society, etc (where as a religious person may well have the same reaction for their faith in god)."
notsarc,"i don't know if you're joking or not but you made me laugh, thank you :)"
notsarc,i have a reputation to maintain. most people stay on this site for about a year. i've been here for almost 3 years now? i guess you haven't learned that you shouldn't try to teach a pig to dance. nor have you learned that you shouldn't wrestle with a pig. you can't win and the pig likes it ;)
notsarc,oh yes i forgot there are some who believe that the property of free-will permeates the universe and is shared by all things animate or otherwise. there is a mathematical proof floating around someplace of it. but since i do not think that there is in fact such thing as free-will i have not bothered to collect it. humans do not have free-will simply because there is nothing for human will to be free of.
notsarc,"i guess you get some credit, but this seems to be way more effective."
notsarc,"british kid with too much time on his hands. oh yeah, and he's a virgin."
notsarc,"oh yes, i know the one. sorry for my horrible memory emoticonxhoho"
notsarc,"i'm not incredulous because miller isn't here, i'm incredulous that not a single one of the 'millions of other religious evolutionists' are here."
notsarc,"see what i mean, and there are 2 f's in d-i-f-f-e-r-e-n-t, dearie."
notsarc,"again, you speak as if gays and lesbians are not worthy of their relationships being sacred to them. as if gays and lesbians are unable to hold dear any concept of commitment, loyalty, partnership.  what a sad and mean little man you are."
notsarc,"because all children should have parents who want them dearly.btw, ""moral relativism"" is absurd. a phase people pass through as they discover diversity and is bewildered by it, thinking all are equally valid. it is a stance of both immature/superficial reasoning and moral depravity. "
notsarc,"i agree, it is we that it is ridicules that we have gotten so into controlling stuff that now we even have a way to control natural courses, but i guess like i said before if it is to stop your child from suffering a sickness then i guess that is okay (still bad) but better than just being a complete control freak, or being selfish"
notsarc,yeah but i don't hate gays because they are still people i just hate the sin and the lifestyle that they are in.  wow i have never seen an atheist who is against gay marriage. i am impressed.
notsarc,"you seem to be lost in our jokes, you have to tell people you're joking so they know. and you got the punctuation wrong, in the russian phrase. the only way for it not to sound insane in russian, would be to put it as: '___ _ __. __'. calling someone '__', means things are serious, and you're ready for a fight. if you claim it to be a joke, you're just insane. so i assume that you got the punctuation wrong, and it was your signature."
notsarc,"oh yeah! i remember tulip. calvinism seems to be more realistic, as it's more correctly grounded in man's sinful nature."
notsarc,"no, darling....i'm a religiously 'lax', but 'spiritually active' episcopalian. but, what if i was a believer in the nation of islam? would that justify your bigotry and racism? i think not. check the 1st amendment, which you conveniently omit."
notsarc,"i feel the opposite is true. i feel a lack of hierarchy adds complication to the layout. it's pretty functional don't get me wrong. freaking cool site, but i mean you have all this opportunity to explore hierarchy and color (brand = two colors, blue/orange, arguments has 2 choices...). they even dabbled in it a little with the 'add argument' buttons above. the grid structure of the layout seems mildly confusing as well. for instance, the vertical alignments of usernames with their respective arguments could match up more uniquely to aid in clarity. or if the leading (space between lines of text) wasn't so consistent, each 'argument' might be better framed visually, without the addition of graphics or color. obviously, this is not gospel or some fantastic soultion, i just think lack of color could be one of a few ideas on improving clarity and functionality of the site."
notsarc,"homework should take as long as needs to, also how do you have 9 hours school btw? and putting in 4 hours is impressive, assuming you don't have someone with a cat o' nine tails standing behind your chair. when i was your age i went absolutely insane, i'm amazed you can maintain such discipline."
notsarc,"Because when something passes every experiment thrown at it and when something fits observation better than anything else, then it's as near as damnit fact. We can get pedantic over this if you want, but the conclusion that reaches is that there are no facts. "
notsarc,"would you consider yourself philosophical? no, i don't think philosophy is useful. everything they claim that cannot be supported by science is simple word games, like the ontological argument. lolzor is the first person i have discussed philosophy with ever, and i'm not impressed with philosophy's lack of demonstrative capabilities."
notsarc,you are a very good student of buddha. i am very impressed.
notsarc,"great choice. you may remember her from the beethoven movies, she played the mother in part 3. i've seen that film at least a dozen times and i like it more with each viewing.  yeah i know what you mean, but i can't help watching sometimes,lol.. i treat it like taking a trip to the candy store, i'm always surprised at how much research some of these atheists will do to debunk god..."
notsarc,"when i was in high school lots of the kids stole stuff all the time... stuff their parents didn't want to buy them, peer pressure etc. i'm not trying to be an ass either i'm just surprised at your views on this...  maybe i'll make a debate and we can see what people on here think."
notsarc,"alright, i think i see your point know. however, i think the only way in which conservatives would be socialist is that they're soo capitalist they end up effectively swinging back to the other end of the spectrum by making people want to kill them. which is a silly argument because the proletariat ain't never rose up and not settled for simple tax breaks or what have you. furthermore, i'm intrigued by your fascism point, i'm just wondering how it affects the debate. are you saying that essentially all political ideals can effectively be reduced to the same ideology at their basest level?"
notsarc,reckon you don't know much about christianity then.  when you can bust the resurrection of jesus christ then you might have something to argue about. until then your claim that christianity is untrue is simply a lot of hot air.
notsarc,"i'm surprised homeland security can't have gun's in dc banned. it's a federal designation, is it not?"
notsarc,"yeah cartman is definately the best, i love how how epicly his evil is portrayed as e.g. scott tenorman must die"
notsarc,"this guy's flip-flopped more times than i can count. i'm not surprised, nor will i be if he fails to follow through on his words."
notsarc,"no, but i went over there and checked and i guess by time stamp you were first. ;)"
notsarc,"wow that's an excellent bit of knowledge. i didn't know that about the ps updates, i only had 1 and 2 and i felt like the hassle of continually buying a new one was not worth the free internet. also, as for the red ring of death on xbox, i guess i wasn't an extreme enough gamer to let mine over heat."
notsarc,"i am surprised at your response since i see your posts as well considered and stated. i asked the question and you answered. to me it was clearly, by definition, inflammatory. we can agree to disagree and let readers make their own determination."
notsarc,"oh yeahrubbish rubbish,scientifically speaking, human life (using a most bsic term) begins at conception. the twins exist as two seperate entities the moment each contains the individual human dna. seems to me you better be certain when it begins before you go around ending it. if you are driving at night an you ""think"" you might see a person ahead in the middle of the road you are hopefully not gonna drive over that person. Instead that uncertainty should lead you to stop. If you dont like that example, consider a hunter who is unsure what is in the bushes. "
notsarc,"i'm surprised no one has mentioned the subject of quantum mechanics in this thread. it seems to be a very good example of the concept, instead of perhaps parallel lines. the fact that things can exhibit mutually incompatible properties of either a particle or a wave depending on how we observe them is incomprehensible, yet certainly reality, no? and i think this is just one example of the apparent incomprehensibility of qm . . ."
notsarc,john mccain is nothing more than another rino. he is the media's darling from the gop.
notsarc,"take another look. we certainly do have our hands firmly on the levers of power. sixty us senators, a substantial majority in the house, a president who represents the death of reaganism once and for all. a solidly pro-choice president and congress. a president and a congress who understand that each of us is responsible for all the rest of us. oh yes, this country will emerge from the bush depression and the optional bush wars with a new sense of direction and a new prosperity. by the next election, there will be so few congressional republicans that they can caucus in the mens' room - provided, of course, that larry craig has not returned for a visit and is using it for other purposes. the naysayers can either get on the train or get left at the station.emoticonxsmilie"
notsarc,"however, just because the majority of people share something in common doesn't always mean the truth? very good. philosophers call this type of argument 'argumentum ad populum'. it is a fallacy that many people are prone to commit. you can choose a sonnet and correctly pick's its emotion but you can never be so sure i agree. shakespearean scholars often disagree about very miniscule details. but i think just because they are not 'sure', that doesn't mean that they can't be certain. maybe you could go google 'shakespeare sonnet 1' and read just the first poem of his sonnets collection. tell me what you think! i'm sure that shakespeare will charm you like he has charmed so many."
notsarc,"That's is ridiculously poor logic. Simply becuase the church makes mistakes doesn't mean it's incorrect in all other charges. The US government is WAY more corrupt than the Catholic Church, and yet we obey every god-damned thing big brother makes us do. "
notsarc,oh yes i forgot to answer the key question: where does information come from. its a simple answer. from a local decrease in the degree of disorder. ie a reversal of local entropy. see adami for a development in mathematical and biological terms.
notsarc,"pro-choice is a sexist concept. it only applies to women. pro-choice doesn't give you much of a choice. it sounds like what you're saying is that anything that has to do with only one gender, is sexist. if not, please clarify.  pro choice does give you a choice. you can either continue the pregnancy, or seek an abortion.  the pro life argument eliminates abortion and mandates that you continue the pregnancy (barring rape, etc).  if you're joking, then ignore this."
notsarc,"yeah! its a benefit to be able to do a thing like that. i'm amazed that we've come so far in technology and science, but i think there is a line of what we can offer people. its not like they're gonna chose whether they want to have an egg or a bagel for breakfast."
notsarc,"So according to one of the people who conducted the study don't go using their results as a tool for arguing against abortion.One woman I know had an abortion a short time after she was married. I also know she has regrets that she had the procedure. I considered what she had to say about her experience and thought about the 14 year old son she now has. From what she told me, I could plainly see she would never have had her son if she had not had her abortion as her circumstances would have changed beyond recognition. Perhaps she gets depressed about the child she never had because of her abortion. However, her son is a fantastic boy whom she loves very much. So we cannot simplify in quite the way you seem to infer that we can. "
notsarc,"sigh - - don't care - - and tossing around bible verses and insulting people when debater disagrees with you is? darling, all you do is alienate them."
notsarc,"quite frankly,i am astounded by you homosexuals (or homosexual supporters) who claim to hate judging yet judge religious people.....those who judge and those who don't... if i were to say a controversial statement such as 'whats the point of entering an exit?' you would have been hurt or angered..yet you would make disrespectful,hatred-provoking comments that was quite the opposite of the message you were spewing just arguments prior to your comment."
notsarc,oh really? hitler placed fear in those who wanted to oppose him in germany. fear is the best weapon to crush opposition.
notsarc,i am surprised people wanted m-80s and stuff like that legal. they accounted for most of the injuries due to fireworks and most of the fires. probably not a smart idea to have them.
notsarc,"i'm kind of amused by the idea that the king james version is the most accurate, there are a lot of fairly well documented flaws, like the introduction of unicorns into the old testament. you also seem to imply that modern translations were dreamed up by a couple of drunken biblical scholars with nothing better to do on a friday evening, whereas most are at least as rigorously researched as the kjv, and often with a greater number of sources available."
notsarc,"while i can't say i'm a history buff, i'm not shocked about all that either. perhaps it's because i'm mostly a misanthropist."
sarc,"ummmmmmm, because it was built in 1932-1935, and has nothing whatsoever to do with the founders or early government leaders, nor with what they believed was correct? you really are the master of the art of self-pwn, archie."
sarc,You seem to require a slick answer to a complicated question - so how about this:Question: Was Stalin a communist ?Answer: That's what he said he was.Hope this is glib and vacuous enough to meet with your exacting standards.
sarc,"are you telling me you cannot figure out how creating a gay-hostile atmosphere causes and condones anti-gay bullying? forsooth! butter wouldn't melt in your mouth, would it."
sarc,"i'm not 'claiming victory' after going off track to an unrelated topic. what i am addressing is related because i am saying it is irrelevant. how is that not related? in fact, this is another example of you changing the subject matter. to point out that they are irrelevant. i thought that was clear."
sarc,Rants? Obsessive-compulsive? How so? I don't insult you with every post as you do me? What's you major problem? Perhaps you need to go pray.
sarc,are you done spamming and threatening me with admin? that's just lame and pathetic.
sarc,"but it makes you look a fool that you make comments without knowing. doesn't it. so you think that just because you enter a debate half-way, you can still give an uninformed opinion? weren't you the one ready to laugh at me? i won't laugh at you. i am only saddened by your personal attacks. yes, repeating yourself. i know what they say, you know what they say. i don't agree with them, on these points. answers in genesis are 'right' by your account on this occasion - see my previous post about us both being 'selective' in the information we use; again a lack of insight into your own thought processes. i disagree with them. do you agree with their claim that speciation in fact disproves evolution? i bet you've been very selective here too!"
sarc,"No more hypocritical than somebody actively harping on me for citing the Huffington Post, but then HAVING NO negative comment for the RNC embracing NewsMax...But here's an idea.You probably wouldn't vote for me cause I cited Huffington Post, right?So logically, one should ALSO NOT VOTE for Republicans who embrace NewsMax, right???emoticonXDonnoNah. I don't expect that kind of consistency..."
sarc,"Liberals are squawking about more funding for atheist groups? Homosexuals don't deserve equality? Liberals are pro-terrorism?Goodness, even your backtracking just digs the hole deeper. Just can't help it, can you?"
sarc,"do you seriously mean to suggest that the entire campaign, election, and inauguration would have taken place under the scrutiny of the world without this vital discovery being made? if so, it looks as though you and phelps both set bells to ringing when you pass by. the bells say, 'bong, bong, bong!!"
sarc,"are you a little bit retarded or something? don't get me wrong sleazyrider i love babies, they're delicious!"
sarc,"doh, you used the 'l' word. how dare ye! (tsk, tsk) :p don't you know? you can't use the term 'lifestyle,' you have to use the description of lifestyle instead. that usually works much better. gotta know the rules to talk with the gay rights folk here, don't ya know? lol see, if you use the word, they can't stay on topic and so then your use of the 'l' word becomes the topic. it's just too damn distracting for 'em."
sarc,"so, global warming no, but weather control devices, yes? perhaps too many people are playing red alert these days..."
sarc,"Tell that to a 17 year old kid!! Haven't you ever been a 17 yera old horny ****** befor?Wait I forgot who I was talking to,.. more than likely not."
sarc,"uh huh. you prefer to be left alone so you can butcher all the unborn babies you want. besides engaging in infanticide, do you know what's wrong with your liberal mentality? you've slaughtered a whole generation of future scientists, teachers, and taxpayers - the latter in sufficient numbers that they would have been able to fund your invasive obamacare in its entirety, along with other nanny-state entitlement programs. turkeys. you losers ought to be caned and deported."
sarc,"you and omegawatsit are the we? or are you the same person? whatever, i'm glad for you. keep up the study and you might achieve the dizzy heights of the mid thirties by next year!"
sarc,"so was dominating and enslaving of women. doesn't mean we should do it just because it has historicity.  actually i've heard this idea by numerous people, on both sides of the issue. i can see the merits myself--give couples' benefits in a way that doesn't utilize a cultural and religious institution that has nothing to do with legality to begin with. that way at least cultural marriage doesn't have to be redefined to any extent and legal benefits would no longer be any sort of reflection of any one group's cultural and ideological views.  by the way, what do you mean by 'anti-gay' in your phrase 'anti-gay people'? that's always important to nail down."
sarc,"irrelevant. what about the common people that weren't blessed with god's son? revenge: definition, synonyms from answers.com tr.v., -venged, -venging, -venges. 1. to inflict punishment in return for (injury or insult). 2. to seek or take vengeance for (oneself or another person); avenge. n. 1. the act of taking vengeance for injuries or wrongs; retaliation. 2. something done in vengeance; a retaliatory measure. 3. a desire for revenge; spite or vindictiveness. 4. an opportunity to retaliate, as by a return sports match after a defeat. tell me, simone, how exactly does using force to defend oneself qualify as revenge? revenge is tracking down the person that wronged you and cutting their throat when they're at their most vulnerable. revenge isn't killing your attacker because you're in fear of your own life."
sarc,"So lets see, you referred to how the 1st amendment applied to the states, posted the 14th amendment privileges and immunities clause and then asked if I thought something was unclear. Of course the privileges and immunities clause is often mistaken to have incorporated the 1st amendment by people who don't know what they are talking about but this is merely coincidence because you randomly quoted part of the 14th amendment but implied it all. Now if I changed it to what it said above would you feel that is an accurate statement? Probably, considering you don't seem to understand a blatant difference between ""original understanding"" and ""original constitution).Your pride ruins you my friend."
sarc,"what country are you from? in america the people have never had the ability to decided law. the legislature writes it, the executive approves it, and the judiciary interprets it. the people have no direct say what so ever."
sarc,"Dude, you only figured that out now? I'm disappointed in you. just joking. Everything he states has a hidden agenda."
sarc,"so why have darwinists ignored symbiosis for decades if it was so compatible? same with developmental biology? why have developmental biologists been locked away in closets, never to be heard from until recently when they've forced themselves upon the scientific community? the reality is you have no choice: accept that organisms cooperate with each other and respond purposefully and intelligently to the environment or else. tell me though: do you now admit that individuals evolve, not populations?"
sarc,"'lame apologetics'? well, i guess if you say so, with your invincible assurance of being right whenever you open your mouth, it would be futile to contradict you.  at least you haven't accused me of being 'prejudiced' against science.  james."
sarc,"this is supposed to be meaningful, coming from someone who won't even read the replies in his own train wreck threads? get real."
sarc,"show me the post where i want a theocracy or eat it.  back at you.  god creates life in a mothers womb (psalm 139:13, etc.).  you can't stand the truths in the bible, can you? you have to hem and haw and do a barack obama and try to spin it away. it's not working for you, pappi. jesus is the resurrected savior and god creates life. and you can't stand the truth."
sarc,"so steeeeve, how long have you supported the confiscation of all privately held firearm in the us?  c'mon, you know you want to.emoticonxkillemoticonxclown some gun-grabbing anti-constitutionalists wear a rather convincing disguise."
sarc,Really? Why don't you go out and start randomly hurting and killing people and see how far that argument gets you in court.
sarc,"You call me or a family I may have, a perversion(sorry the word was ""perversity""), but that is not hate? I believe I am probably younger than you, but that doesn't mean I was born yesterday."
sarc,"not much on psychology either huh? whachos pretty much just run alone, sane people will have nothing to do with them. are your handlers programming you for the next hit?"
sarc,"The truth hurts doesn't it? They are anti my morals, anti my family, anti my equality, anti my america, and defintely homophobic and I would add one more bigot."
sarc,"because gc hears things all woggly. the message from god is for shepherds to tend to ignorant, mindless sheep. but, with dope-smoker ears, and american ignorance it translates into a cowboy...who rustles cattle...and heads them to a quick slaughter. it's like, when the anti-chist makes his appearance, i'll be gods slaughterman. effectively and efficiently removing tru-believahs from the world...cause god forgot some in his rapture thingy (i forget how the logic of these events is supposed to play out...) ummm...aren't we overdue for that bloke to return already? i'm getting antsy for the 2nd coming and all the excitement that leads up to that glorious event. think holding my breath will make it happen any sooner?"
sarc,"behavior dictates risk. some practices are 'more risky' than others. but to say gays are more prone to hiv infection, suggest that heterosexuals are immune, or less prone...which is factually false. role models?? what are you talking about? you don't even know.  old camp fruits? you've lost the little mind that you had.  your daddy is more of an 'old camp fruit', than i ever could be, girlfriend.  and i'm in a monogamous marriage for the past 10 years. i need no announcements. you?"
sarc,"not true at all. hate crime legislation protects straights as well as gays. nothing 'special' there. so you make a claim, but can provide no example to document the veracity of your claim. meh... what i expected. the ruling is garbage. 'ex-gays' are supposedly straight, right? so they are already protected under existing legislation. if we had a bunch of democrats who changed to republicans, and then insisted they should be known as 'ex-democrats', would we need another legal status for them? no."
sarc,"So let me get this right. To counter Accipiter's statement that you have the intellectual maturity of a 10 y/o, you string together a bunch of words that you don't understand in context that makes absolutely no sense? Point - set - match Accipiter."
sarc,"oh, so business owners don't make 'real' contributions to society? whoa boy, slow down there. i didn't say that government offices should be passed down. what are you going to do...make inheritence illegal? you didn't read my answer obviously. just because people have money doesn't mean they have to share it. the government doesn't have the right to take money away from the rich and give it to the poor. so what if rich people don't give money to the poor! it's their choice. god tells us to give money to the poor, but he also gave us a free will. it's not the governments responsibility to help the poor, it's the church's responsibility."
sarc,really? i never miss the chance to tell everyone that i'm going to heaven? i challenge you to quote me ever bragging that i'm going to heaven and you're not. what i have done is promised you mockers and scoffers that the day will come when you will learn the truth about how wrong you are to reject the living god. but never have i boasted that i am going to heaven while you're not. and never has my motivation for promising you that you will ultimately learn the truth been to make such a point. so quote my posts kronus. prove me wrong and defend your lying claim. and i want links to posts in context to the debate and point being made at the time.
sarc,"How do you know it is him? It's a simple question. IF he is writing as Lurch, and someone else comes onto a board, as Ungerdunn, who is just as rude (which is what you are saying), you assume it's the same person? Or, is it because they both claim to be biologists? I guess that having another person enter a forum, and claim to be a biologist would narrow it down to just the same person emoticonXClown All you've done is said you know it is him because one writer is as rude as the other... and that this gives his identity away by some mysterious process, probably I don't understand this as I've never read set-theory! emoticonXWow What should be a very easy question becomes you repeating ""I know it is him"".Also, has he been banned as Lurch on these other fora?"
sarc,"black unemployment is at 19 -20%. the economy is in the toilet, as are obama's approval ratings. and you're swilling kool aid and saying you know best? lol! that's why you liberals are dangerous. you're too steeped in folly to understand what's going on. how's that hope and change working out for you? emoticonxbouncer epicurus apparently never read the book of revelation where god levels the evildoers. and you look up to that? what's the matter with you? you didn't read it either to know epicurus is three sheets to the wind on that? that's why you liberals are dangerous."
sarc,"Ok, so if we are going to let everything take the ""normal course of nature"", then lets just let everyone die. Have cancer? Too bad, its the natural course of nature that you die. What about heart failure? Sorry, no paddles of life for you. We're going to let nature take its course. Just like your beloved pope, nature is not always right."
sarc,"whoa! duo. give the kid a chance. it seems that you are skeptical that he can offer empirical 'proof' that his god exists. certainly, since he is a 'philosophy and theology' major he must understand the implications of 'proof' in the context of science, as well as the meaning of the term 'empirical'. after all, wouldn't those ideas be something that a philosopher would be expected to understand? so let's await his 'empirical proof' without laughter. wait until he presents his 'empirical proof' before we laugh."
sarc,"so you reference shakespeare to explain the song of solomon? seems rather convoluted, but whatever."
sarc,"sorry your mightiness, thank you for your graciousness of addressing us common folk.  are you really that obtuse? i swear you and easy share a brain. i clearly pointed out that this commandment talks about respect for authority. personally, i think this applies to single parents, families with 2 daddies, or children raised in an orphanage.  yet i bet somehow in the formative years of the children, they are taught some form of respect for authority.  how so? i didn't write it, i'm just commenting on it. and again, i prefer to replace 'mother and father' with authority. regardless, who says respect = fear? maybe you and easy really do share a brain...you both seem to think you can define words as you see fit to lend creedence to your arguments."
sarc,"You still don't get it do you, Smiley... emoticonXBanghead If cupcakes were human? It would."
sarc,"apparently you need to read up on up-to-date cases of fetus viability and premature birth success statistics. that's right, and she does it after the baby is born by caring for it as well. so? i guess you'd also be in favor of it being legal for a mother to not allow her baby to live because she has to care for it after it's born too, with that reasoning. there are many, many women in the pro-life movement. my wife is one of them and she is a lot more passionate about it than i am. (trust me, you don't want to be in a room with her after you've killed a baby!) if you think this is a men versus women issue, you are sadly mistaken."
sarc,Does she shampoo your beard and iron your turban too? Towel head.
sarc,"so, you admit defeat to a child? you have no argument and can only name call. answer my posts with something other than ad hominem or admit defeat."
sarc,"have you ever even heard of www.google.com? http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&q=...e+search&meta= and this is your measure of what makes something true? well then, the epic of gilgamesh, the illiad, and the oddysey must also be true by that reasoning. they've survived just as long, and are still being studied to this day for their insights into those ancient cultures."
sarc,a bit over the top here eh? quicksand?...butcher babies? wow...very sensational... i have a question for ya ez? do you own any slaves? do you have a beard or long hair? have you stoned any non-virgin brides lately. seeing as though you are so adherant to the bible....i figure you at best have smited a neighbor or two this week?
sarc,yeah and i suppose being confronted with reason is a challenge for you too... i mean hey i don't call your marriage a lie or your wife a whore but you can do the same to my significant other? tidings of comfort and joy to you too scrooge...
sarc,"Indeed, a coward I might be, but alas you have anonymity!Sorry if I wax lyrical. How do you know what I've done with my life? I know you think yourself clever, but do you really think you are that clever? Wow!"
sarc,"every single time you make the assisinine statement 'the baby isn't the woman's body' you downplay the part the woman's body plays. maybe it isn't the body - but it can't live without the woman's body. the owner of said body should be making decisions for said body.  when you are willing to force pregnancy against the will and without the voice of the woman who is pregnant - you are hi-jacking her body. i forget - are you one of those force the rape victim to carry the baby lifers? pretty close and i will fight you hard if you try trample one inch of it.  i still don't give a damn what they may or may have not have thought about abortion, nor was that an argument i was trying to make."
sarc,"not to me, but let's not quibble about things we can't change. let's talk about something that we can change...for a change. we could argue about it forever and never change one thing that's written. how about making a proposal suited to fit those whose religious beliefs tend to make us feel inferior? or passing legislation that more medical staff be trained in 'special' fields of medicine for certain diseases so that constant referrals won't bounce us off the walls."
sarc,"steve if i thought i could help you i would. i was called on using incorrect facts and your shooting out words like bagillion? you need to know when you in a dream. reality is scary i understand that.  i can't make a blind man see steve, if i could i would. seems you can't make an aware man sleep as well."
sarc,do you think i would lie to you? http://panasonic.net/pavc/lumix/line_up/slr.html nice photos!
sarc,"oh, so now you're claiming to be a psychologist too?! wow, you sure get aroud a lot!  hmmm...a failed shrink arguing over homosexuality with actual homosexuals. what does that suggest?  tomshairybills; you are way over your head and i really hate to be the one who has to keep telling you this, but you're not doing yourself any favors by continuing to dig that hole you're in even deeper."
sarc,am i psychic or what! didnt i predict that there would be those who would avoid my question? am i good or what!
sarc,The VPC has a political agenda. The FBI? That is like saying I believe Coke taste better than Pepsi because the Coke commericial says so.
sarc,"So it's just fine if someone says ""gay people are prone to force Christians out of their towns"", eh? Interesting. emoticonXWowJust ""typical English usage"", after all ...."
sarc,i am looking for you to recognize that a pregnancy can't successfully happen without addressing the circumstances of the mother - whatever those may be. you can dismiss everything but health/life of the mother but i can pretty damned well assure you she won't. and whether you like it or not - the pregnancy can't succeed without her. get it? she is not a barbie you can bend to your will with law. do you see her? do you recognize that babies grow and live inside women? address all her issues or you will fail in your endeavors. oh - and i don't require your sympathy - my life is great.
sarc,"But I suppose this is all MY/Our Fault too. Huh Brady?First all of Mexico's violence was my/our fault until it was found out that the ATF was actually running guns into Mexico, now what some slimeball does in Norway is my fault. Get a clue."
sarc,jos 24:15? what book of the bible is that? i thought i knew the names of all the books of the bible used by protestants but i don't recognize jos.
sarc,"as to the first part, i answered you above. regarding the second part; what in the world are you talking about? girls who are born from unfertilized eggs? and boys born of virgin mothers? can you post any evidence of these cases? beside jesus of course, because we know his father is god and that he possesses the holy spirit."
sarc,"we'd have define consensus first. if it is 50% + 1 then there probably is one. then after that, who is saying they are wrong? prejudice as its finest. lesz likes to stereotype people to an extreme that can never be changed. i have never told lesz my views on global warming and lesz has shown no interest in gathering facts about what others believe."
sarc,Are you going to go and urinate on his grave as well?My! My! What hatred and vitriol! What does it feel like to have so black a heart?
sarc,"what the heck? owning an airport is evil now???  it is becoming clear at this point that you're pretty much grabbing at anything you possibly can, no matter how silly, to bash jerry falwell. he did enough bad things to where you don't need to resort to the benign things, to bash him. the man is gone. you don't have to worry about him anymore. move on."
sarc,"EZ. That is not what I said.I would think a Bible website would be good for biblical information, but for archaeological information? not so much.If you want to provide archaeological evidence of the Exodus, why don't you seek out information from an archaeology sources? Please answer this.If I wanted to seek archaeological evidence to confirm something that happened to a people that was written about in their ancient writings, I wouldn't seek a specialist in the ancient writings as a resource, I would seek an archaeology expert. Doesn't that make sense?"
sarc,"You are going to need to be very specific here buckwheat:Exactly how did you deduce that I think I am so much better than you?And please, be brief."
sarc,"Wouldn't professing atheism cover that?Or were you looking for something else? I'll call mine ""Bertrand""."
sarc,"And how is that? Your stereotypical view is supposed to represent ""truth""?? LMAO. B**** (and I mean that ""lovingly"") I'm friggin married. For 10 years. I don't accept ""gay sex proposals"", unless it's from my husband. And he ain't ""white"". I had my flings with y'all....and y'all ain't right. I moved on. And learn to use English ""correctly"".

sarc,"other than showing your ability to bold your false or irrelevant claims what was accomplished here? as for the date that the nt books were written, more importance could be given to those guesses if any still existed or if early christians could have refrained from changing the word of god. sorry current christians do it also so unfair to blame just the early ones."
sarc,"i don't know, terran. are you scared poohbear? do you actually have any evidence to bring to us? we'd love to see some! really we would! if you could show us some hardcore, physical evidence that proves god did it, it would be the scientific revelation of the century! oh what's that? you don't have any? not even a poorly crafted straw-man argument? damn, and here i was thinking you were capable. oh yes, and if you could give us some firm, solid evidence that darwin is burning in hell, we would all drop our copies of origin and bow down the lord.  whats that? you don't have any...?"
sarc,"'if carrying guns became legal, then police could no longer arrest people for carrying guns illegally!' emoticonxrolleyes really? i suppose you'd be happier if only the 'bad guys' were armed, because that would make them easier to identify."
sarc,"i just spat coffee on my new monitor...  wanna catch a movie, sinjin? i'll get the popcorn if you'll bring that yellow salt..."
sarc,"as i observed earlier, you seem intent on attacking islam. why else would you devote so much energy to a thread entitled 'muhammed's child bride'? you've said it yourself, as in... and... howard suggested to you that you might learn something about islam by reading rumi. you asked me to quote to you from rumi? very well... spring is christ, raising martyred plants from their shrouds. their mouths open in gratitude, wanting to be kissed. the glow of the rose and the tulip means a lamp is inside. the wind is the holy spirit. the trees are mary. the scent of joseph's shirt comes to jacob. a red carnelian of yemeni laughter is heard by muhammad in mecca. and... moses, the inner light of revelation, lit up the top of sinai, but the mountain could not hold that light."
sarc,really? is the aaas a non-scientific organization too? hope you don't read the journal science because it isn't good enough for you.  you just choose to attack the source because it disagrees with your viewpoint. don't let science get in the way of your fanatic beliefs. emoticonxgood  if it isn't a peer-reviewed journal than why does it have to be reviewed by two experts in the field? why is the journal associated with the aaas? why do you attack the source and not offer one that supports your view? is it because you can't provide evidence for any claim you make or because you enjoy the taste of sand? keep digging that hole dane.
sarc,"'define'? as if it's a definition? tell me, archie: precisely how ignorant of this topic are you? so you want me to give you the better part of what could amount to a semester-long advanced college course in a single post? do you really think that you'll understand curvature of space-time as induced by matter when you can't even understand the difference between a scientific theory and a drunken guess? do you really think i have any inclination of trying to tell you about the technicalities of relativity when you don't understand that light and gamma rays are the same thing? get real. you need to get your head out of your xxx before you'll be able to even hear me."
sarc,"if reality conflicts with the bible, there are people that tend to 'reinterpret' the bible so that to them it agrees with reality. this is inexcusable in my opinion. to me, the very fact that they convince themselves that the bible says something it doesnt is worse than simply admitting that the bible contradicts reality. what is the point of depending on the bible for truth when youre going to interpret it to suit something entirely contrary? its like telling your kids that the moon is made of cheese, and then later when confronted with contradictory evidence, rather than admit you lied, you tell your kids that they misinterpreted what you said."
sarc,whatever happened to the unborn baby? No consulting him or her I guess. Even though the unborns body is being is the one being torn apart.
sarc,of course you can pass that sort of opinion off and some people actuall believe it. how on earth it can be tested? i guess we're only going to respect the sweeping generalisation a typical atheist trick!
sarc,"yes, how silly of me to debate him on 'points'. i should debate him on .... what? and here you are again criticising one side, and not the other. he was insulting; you remained stony silent. because he denies that darwin ever used it. darwin did. small point but he entered into all sorts of highly spurious rationales rather than accepting this point (again you were stony silent on this) what is evolution? what is evidence? well that would be a first time. but why ask now, after several days, after he's gone by the wayside, after he made the claim again and again and again? you made no statement while he was claiming this false claim? why your sudden interest in digging all posts i've responded too?"
sarc,you kind of made a good point here... both the government and the church have ulterrior motives for 'helping the poor': the politicians hope to gain votes and the church hopes to gain converts...both groups of suckers will be paying back for the rest of their lives in one way or another.  and the church collects more of 'it's own money' to purchase more poor sinners. both groups are indentured servants to their masters. what do you mean 'generous with your own money'? isn't that what the government is? perhaps the christians don't want to help all the poor - only those who belong to their church or those willing to sell their souls to it. both are doing a terrible job of 'helping the poor'.
sarc,the liberal propoganda army is on the way? the man  must be lonesome!
sarc,"fend not really. they took it out because it was a blatant pro-christian argument.  and those two threads only serve to prove my point. the only iders are fundamentalists christians or muslims. there is no science in id. only godiddit.  explain to me how the same processes that date geological areas that are used by evolution and the big fossil fuel corporations is wrong.  explain to me how its correct when the fossil fuel industry uses it to find fossil fuels but when scientists use it to support evolution, it's false. that makes no sense whatsoever.  explain to me why something tried and true needs to be reformatted. or are all these products science brought us fake?  the delusion of creation."
sarc,"Oh spare me the condemnation ya' XXXX-hard. You aren't interested in saving souls. If you were, you would bother to have payed attention to the countless times you have been told that your abrasive, insulting tactics DON'T WORK. Plus an eternity in hell or an eternity with a terroristic God? I think I will stick with being able to live with myself for even today, let alone an eternity."
sarc,"that's probably being saved for the next round of national election fodder. maybe something on the order of occupying all the me, making it a christian democracy while we use their oil for their own good? with every family owning their own home, two cars and a boat. wait, they've used that promise and it failed. not to worry, i'm sure they'll come up with something that'll keep the sheep headed towards the cliff."
sarc,"Evidence? We're talking religion here. Religion. If there were evidence, then it would be science."
sarc,thugs ?? i thought one of them was an actor ? oh wait ... i guess that would be plausable today!
sarc,"yes, it's david koresh's fault that the fbi burnt children alive, right? disgusting. however evil or deluded david koresh might have been, nothing he did compares to gassing and then setting on fire large numbers of children, an act you apparently applaud."
sarc,"if homosexuals don't think, how can they choose to become good vaginal penetrators? the fact is, the more homosexuality there is, the less abortions. if you were a gay you could rest assured that your man-wife would never abort once. are you willing to sacrifice the lives of billions of innocent children to your personal feelings like lust towards vaginas?"
sarc,"ok to lie?? no. having people preaching 'the evolution of species from a cell to every living creature and plant life on earth', and tell me 'its darwin's origin of species, you should try reading it sometime', after i had just presented them an entire paragraph from hitler's meine kempf - entertaining! having your beloved talkorigins crew flunk the test straight-up as they were asked, 'who said the following, _________, hitler or darwin?', while going a whopping 0-3 for a revealing score of zero............ ...............priceless!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
sarc,"is hillary clinton a truthful politician? perhaps 'truthful politician' is an oxymoron. if her robust commentary on the iranian regime isn't just an attempt to appease (some) republican sentiment in her bid for the presidency, then she should state what 'clear and unequivocal' policy she recommends that the united states should adopt in order to deal with the threat from iran. i don't think she will make clear what aggressive option she favours, if any - at least during her presidential campaign - on the grounds that it might offend (some) democratic sentiment. james."
sarc,"you're hopeless. what do you thing a stable website in which only authorized personnel have access to would be considered in layman's terms? answer: a secure website.emoticonxbangheademoticonxbanghead i already cited the section of the bill that backs up my statement above, so don't bother trying to refute it."
sarc,"Did you go to college, Trebor? You might want to look up how ""pedophilia"" is spelled. LOL!! Then you can go have a beer with Orion and watch his head swivel."
sarc,V.P.C. once again I am shocked and awed. Why no mention of our fearless atf'sand the agents they caused to be killed. And all the Mexican citizens they have caused to be killed? Oh wait if the vpc did that it would be kinda like jumping outta bed with your partner.SPECIAL NOTE: Some ATF agents are fearless.Drug War Victims Drug WarRantThese are a few of the one known about.It works both way's Brady and more our way much more.
sarc,Do you have to work at becoming so scientifically illiterate? What ever happened to the creationist chant about evolution being a product of pure chance? You seem to chant all of the other creationist tripe.
sarc,"so the old man was doing something criminal by carrying a firearm for self defence? the bar***d! how can you do such a thing, breaking the law like that, or maybe if the criminal who beat him up was the one who actually deserved to be charged, or better shot. so you think that this man who was following the law (texas case) deserved to go to jail for defending his property and anybody else who may have been hurt, killed as a result of their next crime? are you actually insane? have you lost your marbles? what is wrong with you?"
sarc,"since your denying it so strenuously, i can only conclude you therefore support the right of gays to marry the partner of their choice and to enjoy the same benefits you and your spouse enjoy. or was there some other portion of my post that is contradictory to your beliefs? aw, how cute! archie learnt a new word: projecting. how is what i said 'projecting' archie?"
sarc,"trebor, is there any odd chance that you are some what familiar with coptic christian traditions? i don't really expect it of you but i suspect that you may have spent a wee bit of time investigating other religions."
sarc,Not in the mood? Oh I see because they restrict you already your not in the mood to remove the regulations that do not work and insert proper ones that do. Excellent ignore the issue at hand and give no suggestion to improve upon the current laws and restrictions....
sarc,"back to the blame us first, are we? stick to terrorist-supporting iran today. and even if we did, two wrongs still don't make a right."
sarc,do you actually believe that? do you have any evidence? complaining is practically the national passtime here.
sarc,"are you retarded or just ignorant? either way, get your facts right. limbaugh and savage do not have tv shows so if they want to listen to beck they still can on the radio. second, you imply fox fired beck...umm, no. third, the glenn beck program was the third most watched cable news program between two other fox news programs.  i'm not a fan of the glenn beck tv program but at least i'm not going around making stuff up."
sarc,"so let me get this straight, you would violate a womans civil rights to save a fertilized egg, but have no problem killing real people? wow."
sarc,"So, Clinton getting it on with Lewinsky is a sign of intelligence? You can work for the Obama administration with those kinds of smarts. LOl!!"
sarc,"well, then again, we all know the kind of people the nmbla consists of. sick freaks, everyone of them. they have their reasons. chinese girls start their period at three years old hmmm? sorry for the skepticism, but i don't buy it. i can't imagine a three year old starting their period. how is a body like that supposed to sexually mature?"
sarc,you'd be hard-pressed to get me to agree with your definition of 'conservative' . and i'd love to tell them. do you have their e-mail addresses? i'll start with chickenshit kennedy.
sarc,"I take your point.But bloody hell, I couldn't handle a baby at the moment! Does that mean I'm psychologically unready?...probably, but oh well..."
sarc,"by your logic, do i have to be a murdered to understand that murder is wrong? this 'walk a mile in my sandals' stuff is just bs. i don't have to be a woman to view abortion as not being moral."
sarc,"awwww, is little sliiiiiiicky still unhappy with the elections? kiss nancy again and cry on her shoulder we are tired of it. let her wipe your snot nose and have a nice hot cup of tea. :) emoticonxhoho while you are at it, exactly what is the difference between 'regulation' and 'restriction' ? i notice your dope sucking law didn't pass in kalifornia so is that going to stop you? iow, if you don't get caught it is all right? is that your standard for regulation or restriction?"
sarc,"You know, if the God deniers even let the baby out of the mother's womb alive to begin with then he's already one step ahead of the game.As for what to do with him then, show me under the New Covenant where Jesus said to stone kids?Personally, I think we should stone obese, jaded statues of weird looking holy men."
sarc,Dragons and Dinosaurs coexisting only recently? hmm when they did dissapear? Maybe Conan the Barbarian killed them all!
sarc,The penis is not designed for the hand?so you want this entire board to believe you don't wank off! Oh come on.....get real...everybody does it...who are you kidding....You lost all crediblity right there!
sarc,were you hiding under a rock until recently? phelps has been making the news for years for showing up at gay (and other) funerals. i think they even had a phelps-based character picketing funerals in one of those pc gay-rights themed movies like the laravie project didn't they?
sarc,"two reasons: first, i come from a jewish family, and i've never heard of this before. now, i'll grant that nothing says that i should have, but this is news to me. second, and more importantly, trebor is not the person who made the positive claim; you are. it is your burden of proof. no one here can blame me for questioning your bare assertions given your history with falsehoods. so if he doesn't respond in a mere three hours, you declare victory? how about you call me presumptuous again? emoticonxrolleyes for once you acknowledge that you aren't able to back up your claim. congratulations. try it next time without accusing somebody of being cowardly and misleading."
sarc,oh man! what is going on?  i vote for the 2nd coming of christ is near!
sarc,"'we the people of the united states, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defence,[1] promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution for the united states of america.' there you go, easy and archy. that's the only part that matters when it comes to the purpose for the founding of this country. notice that it it based on the authority of 'we the people'. it doesn't say, 'in the name of jesus.' perhaps you either of you can tell me how many times god is mentioned? how many times is jesus mentioned? how many times is religion mentioned? you failed at the first test. can you do better at the second?"
sarc,"'poor bill' ? yes poor poor bill, i really feel sorry for him for having the misfortune to meet monica . anybody who had the bad luck to meet monica deserves our compassion and pity. yes.... poor poor bill....so hillary was a saint and lord knows what monica was !"
sarc,"did someone hack your account, oblivious? you sound like a fsb bot in this post..."
sarc,"Hey, Jack, in case it missed your expert scrutiny, I'm first normally responding to some pro-gay argument that's referenced in a great many of those posts. There's scores of you guys defending such iniquity at any given time. Just look at the last twenty posts and it's five or more of you pro-gay pundits vs. one or two respondents. Seems to me it your cause to promote and defend, just like we're seeing across America. Make you guys a deal: You shut up about it and it will greatly please me to never mention it. I don't suppose you will ever do that now, will you? LOL!"
sarc,"bitm (or whomever), are u sure that you weren't banned because you were caught blatantly lying? cause that seems pretty actionable to me. and welcome back broker! we've missed you're sensible conservativism!"
sarc,"I am just passing on what I seen personally. I am not trying to prove anything. Just sharing an observation. PS...from ""our"" point of view? You got a mouse in your pocket? Please explain."
sarc,"yep. and look at those goalposts flying across the field: so we go from showing where he ever did this to showing where he did it five times. and if five examples are provided? well, show me ten! and if ten are provided, he'll want at least half of his post count (roughly 2500). why? the point has been made, the challenge he himself laid out has been met. still waiting for the proof i'm lying archie. want to head on back to that other thread and show where i lied?"
sarc,"who decides which portions are appropriate for literal interpetation? how od you know they are right? has it ever occured to you that the whole invisible man in the sky thing is probably not a good canidate for literal interpetation?  perhaps, as the roman elite at the time claimed, the bible was compiled, and christianity was heavily pushed, primarily as a method of controlling the people. we know the bible was heavily edited. we know that much of it was written decades after the events occured, and not by the folks claimed. isn't literally interpeting anything that fraudulent a pretty poor idea?"
sarc,"I think you're VERY mistaken.I'm not a republican. Nor a democrat.Never been registered as anything other than 'independent'.I'm such because I think.Unlike a party parrot that you seem to be yourself.Since I'm neither...who the hell can ""I"" be in the minority?Must be your biggoted knee-jerk reaction to think that anyone who doesn't think like you and slurp the Flavor Aid is the opposition and as such must be in the 'enemy party'.And you are a hater because you verbiage is hate filled, caustic and ever insulting. And not in a funny, jestful way but full of vitriol and bile."
sarc,"So you for strict regulation of business but not people? Interesting...do you know who runs businesses? Yeah, people."
sarc,"hmmm. 'wow... and this op made it through the rigorous admin review process? anyway, here is a question for you to ponder about. if god made human from dirt, how come there are still dirt around?' sounds like a joke to me.  evc forum: human evolution (re: if evolved from apes, why still apes?) but we all know that arch is incapable of opening the blue colored links."
sarc,"Rather than address my points in the slightest manner, your response consists entirely of this. (Think I'm surprised?) And you somehow think that I'm the one being defeated? But then, with your ""understanding"" of logic, nobody's surprised."
sarc,"well, did making incest illegal result in women's lifes being put in jeopardy ? because making abortion illegal sure will !"
sarc,"are you kidding? uh, i hate wasting my 1000th post on you, but here goes. i don't believe that the pm was vile and profane, because jitobear doesn't do that unless you get her really ###### off. second, you're not the most credible person on this forum. and no one has lost it. maybe in your mind, but not in reality. is this how you react when you're cornered, when your bible rhetoric fails? because its kind of pathetic."
sarc,Who's God ? Vishnu ? Buddha ? The Great Spirit ? Allah ? Or God ?Waiting............
sarc,And this differs from your cell how? (oh wait it doesn't).
sarc,"I already have, hence the explanation I provided. If you challenge me to show you an error then I will. Did you expect me to try and show something that was true and see if I could convince you it wasn't? When you post your evidence it usually has holes in it, not always but the truth is funny that way. It is very difficult sometimes to cover it up.And stay away from those shrimp, eagles, gays and snowmenThey are all abominations."
sarc,Horse manure. When did you invent that self-serving rule? Put it back in your ditty-bag.
sarc,"knowing more than just a little about my fte compadres, and those that i know personally, they would fight along beside me and i them to preserve our freedoms. to go as far to bow down? when they have taken what smidgen of life is left in me. but in direct answer to your post, jim: they are doing so as we speak."
sarc,"wow, that's a huge blanket statement which you haven't bothered to qualify. guess that means it's just a personal attack because you had no better argument, huh?  just because someone does not like what society has become does not necessarily mean one hates the concept of structural society. unfortunately you haven't qualified either concept in your ad hominem attack of jake."
sarc,"why am i not surprised at your lack of a response to my point? why am i not surprised that you're supplying no evidence? and there are millions of bedrooms with people gettin' busy inside, too. can we rail against those as well? in bed, with their partners. you're married and you still don't know where this generally happens?"
sarc,"go out there and find all kinds of democrat-led, black-led, white-led, mexican-led, etc.. efforts to protect gay rights. just because you can't find them doesn't mean they're against them. saying all republicans are against gay rights because one of them is, is bigoted, stereotypical and childish. quite moronic too. is it also your claim that all blacks are prejudiced because they haven't formed the naawp yet? grow up."
sarc,love vs. pepersack again? what you don't realize is love got her gun.
sarc,"True until proven otherwise eh? Xcaliber and you must get along great.You have things backward and you are probably being confused by the 'experiment to falsify a theory', that is a tenet of science based on the generalization that untrue theories are easily disproved.No logician (and by extension no good scientist) would ever hold a lack of disproof as proof.Oh right theories are never proven, so in fact your definition of theory would go something like this -> 'an idea that is not disproved which we assume is true'."
sarc,Yeah parents like these?...Westboro Baptist Church family disowns daughter ? 20/20 - YouTubeChristian Nutters is what I like to call them..
sarc,"Nice try, but no cigar. I never said that inflation had no effect. Of course it does. But even factoring in the alleged 500% inflation since the 1960s or whatever it happens to be depending on calculation does not account for the huge run-up in the price of crude to nearly $80 not that long ago. My beef has been the resident ""experts"" here who flout their supposed knowledge and money to impress us lesser mortals who reminded them of the iron law of supply and demand. That, by the way, is found in Economics 101. But you knew that, didn't you?So now, it's a ""technical"" correction. What's next? Some wisdom from Joe Granville or the Elliot Wave Theory?Ball in your court."
sarc,"so you are saying that this country is based on principles of judaism? that is a date, dummy. it is not a founding principle. it was how dates were done. and 'our lord' could have been mohamed for all you know, except that it was the standard for dates. no christian principles. so at least you admit that you can't give a single location and that you can't even tell me how many times god, jesus, and religion are mentioned."
sarc,"emoticonXRolleyesThe problem with that?What Obama was saying wasn't a lie... The healthcare legislation Obama was talking about clearly forbids providing services to illegal immigrants.And furthermore, the whole ""showed some guts to speak the truth""???ROFLMAO!There are MILLIONS of people saying all sorts of stupid things about the president.9/12 project???I suppose you think those guys were cowering in their closets refusing to ""show some guts to speak"" (what you think is) ""the truth""..."
sarc,"your truth?? your truth???? does it come in singles or in a bundle? do i get some sort of discount for being agnostic, that's halfway between theist and atheist, ja? does it cost extra to buy the 'be judgmental and condescending, and you will enter heaven' version, or can i just buy the 'i have so many flaws, but when they are exposed or i'm out of hand, i'll just fall back on jesus, and that makes me perfect and whole' one? nah, i'll be satisfied with 'the truth that i know is truth, not faith. let's just skip the faith process.' that hits the spot!"
sarc,"that's not what the bible says. you're playing word games. what next? numerology??? i mean, i can play around with interpreting too. i can take 'roses are red, violets are blue' and interpret it to mean just about whatever i want it to. let's see, roses represent love, and red is the color of blood. a key characteristic of violets is that they have small flowers, and blue means sad. so what 'roses are red, violets are blue' is really and truly saying - and you must all bow down and accept my absolute insight into this - is that 'love is bloody awful, and people with 'small things' are sad'. bet you never knew that's what it was really saying!"
sarc,"Hmmm, well then, God must be unrighteous since we ""evil atheists"" - and tons of other evil people - have not been eliminated. What happened to righteousness NECESSITATING the elimination of evil by killing humans??? Well???I guess that in addition to being unethical and easily manipulated, your God is also terribly inconsistent."

sarc,"A tenth grade education? Why am I not surprised. That explains why you swallow this evo dung, because it makes you feel smart and enlightened.

And here's a clue for you buddy, don't believe everything you read on the internet. Try using common sense before swallowing this tripe and if you want to exercise your common sense muscle, go back and reread all of my posts and try to answer all of my questions objectively. You know, those questions that you and every one of your compadres have completely ignored and not attempted to directly answer at all."
sarc,Does that mean test tube babies are pure and sinless? If so then why don't we just eradicate that whole phase of passing through the birth canal (if that's what IS where we get our sinful nature) and just have test tube babies! Wheeeee!
sarc,"so much bs... where should i start? eugenics is about manipulating genomes of populations. since when are most abortions performed for the purpose of lowering or raising the frequency of certain alleles or traits in populations? if a woman wants to maximize her life, liberty, and happiness, and she feels that she can best do so by aborting a pregnancy, your intended prevention of that action 'flies in the face of the declaration of independence'... (not that the declaration has any legal standing.) whether an embryo or fetus is human is irrelevant. no thing, human or not, has the right to subsist completely on a human without the latter's consent. 'abortive technologies'? you sound like falwell, insisting that cloning destroys life when it does nothing of the sort. please explain your laughable statement."
sarc,I just bet you thought you were smart just now? I'll go you several... How about:1. Murder2. Stealing3. Adultery4. RapeAlmost every culture since the dawn of civilization has put to death those who have trespassed those basics. But I guess you didn't get that on the Recovery Channel huh? Your idiocy is profound only as your ignorance.
sarc,"that's it brady? that's your answer? i don't know, maybe the american people are buying that! emoticonxsmilie like i said, that is what they are after!!!"
sarc,so a vote for an adulterous divorcee is a vote for morality? is this election being held in wonderland? i'm pretty sure mccain falls foul on bearing false witness as well.
sarc,"Was that so hard? Anti gay Christians do want gays to oppose their, marriages, discriminate against them, oppose christians from being able to adopt, and practice thier religion. Since anti gay christians are doing all these things to gay people then that is how they want gay people to treat christians."

sarc,"What's sick is your theological comprehension.God took Ananias and Sapphira (Acts chapter 5) off the earth just for lying. And you want to give JFK, the serial adulterer, a pass? That's how lame your theological thinking is."
sarc,So you are an expert in this like you were about the economics of sending money out of the country?The problem with letting people like you call the shots is that you really have no idea what you are talking about.It's something I see in a lot of conservatives.
sarc,that shouldn't be too hard for an 'educated' person such as yourself to point out in the heller ruling now should it? there have been quite a few rulings post heller. did those courts let 'restrictions' stand? no!
sarc,"your foot would do service as a colander. in australia, a weapon may be legally held for many reasons. self defence is not one of them. you might legally own a weapon for sport shooting, but use it to defend yourself. how hard is that to understand? for a supposed 'expert' not to realise that a drawn pistol is not pointing at ones foot, is a major error commonly made by fantasy gunners."

sarc,"Ah, so I don't like democracy, and yet it is you who in the post are telling me that I have to support McCain's statement. Are you serious? That sure doesn't sound like democracy to me. I also find it funny that you claim that I don't like democracy when my very post stated that I would be voting for the Democrat party. But then, I guess if we don't support Bushyboy and his fellow republicanazis, we must be against democracy, right? Get real, Phyllis."
sarc,"let's say that the law, based upon some kind of verifiable scientific data, decides that some folks are inferior to other folks, and thus less of a person? you know, if the law said 'because you are black, you are less of a person than shomeone who is white. you shouldn't be upset though, all scientific data suggests that you, because you are black, are truly inferior to those who are white.' would you think, because the law said so, that a black person was in fact a non-person?"
sarc,Probably neat excuse. Do you expect jim to back that claim up? emoticonXGood Don't hold your breath.
sarc,Don't you have that other weird warped forum your posting in now?! Go there with your advice.
sarc,i think your right big orn and that is what i was thinking... do you think your level of bitterness has something to do with quality of life? i guess the glass is half empty for those....
sarc,"the law abiding responsible gun owner who gunned them down did so respectfully, right ? emoticonXFrazzledYou gun crazies are the only ones with a sick political agenda, you ought to be all sent to a loony bin and given water pistols."
sarc,"Are you telling me liberals have jobs? You sure can't tell it by all the anti military/war protests, the flag burnings, you saw prior to the start of the war and by all the libs that post here 24/7........They are either unemployed or 12 year old kids out of school for summer vacation.........."
sarc,"no... a debased intellect has things backwards, that would clearly be minds of your ilk buddy. so.. what then? your heart tells you to go jump off a cliff? on contrast that old you book you claim tells me to sit down and live a day, guess what i'm gonna do? go live a day... and avoid watching them have to scrape you off the ground. that old book is about reason, respect, love decency and standards that preserve life... a fallen heart cannot be trusted. i trust a heart governed by that book... rather than a mind with no self control living for the 'heart' - they give heart a bad name. sorry pal... i dont' expect you to understand it, and i am fine with that - it is your choice, but it hasn't been wrong ever, and never wronged anybody."
sarc,"Yes, mulitculturalism is wonderful. You know what else is wonderful? Fact checking:Archie swallows own foot againIt was the second link when I googled his name. At least try to not look like a jackass every time you post."
sarc,"bs, if it's password protected, then how would they access it? then i suppose america would look lovely as the crater in the death star! you're telling me to believe that it exists even though there is no evidence that it does? once again: there's a witness in this courtroom who says that i didn't kill that guy, but i'm the only one who can see him and hear him. in other words, unless the page is showed to me, i have no reason to believe that it exists."
sarc,"ok, i understand now. all those people, including children and the fetuses of pregnant women were all sinful and god had to murder them in tsunamis, earthquakes, etc.,  is that how god deals with overpopulation? i guess that wars are part of god's plan, too, because the recent invasion of iraq wiped out more than 100,000 iraqis according to god's plan for dealing with overpopulation."
sarc,"boy $346,000? i can think of a few $300,000 firearms in existance today. if anyone of them every shot and killed a person, boy it would be sooooo easy to trace it down. so then why bother banning them? using a $300,000 gun to shoot someone is like hit and run in a bright red ferrari in a busy intersection, the cops are going to find you."
sarc,"if you want more downs syndrome children entering the world, why don't you take care of them? what have you ever done for these children? oh that's right, you'd rather just sermonise about how 90% of people are 'hard-hearted'."
sarc,"So, faith and argument from incredulity. If you find it impossible please state exactly what part is impossible. Then maybe an actual scientist could take over.Major in molecular biology? Not even a full degree; not like your going to doing anything original."
sarc,"what did i previously tell you, i.e. well hey, moose, you're in a topic which highly relates to the bible. if you want a secular response there's plenty of those guys around. if you want to chat with me i'll usually be coming from a biblical perspective. but i'll be glad to talk with you on a secular subject if you want. what are you looking for? p.s. please hold your 'honest attempts at discussion' rants, ok? i could easily claim the same with you since you are out of god's wisdom. but i won't. what did you want to know? again, what did you want to know?"
sarc,"so atop a mountain of ignorance is where we will find religious people? yeah, sounds about right to me."
sarc,nice thought. a pity you did not live in the third reich. emoticonxfrazzled if they were captured in the battlefield then they should be treated according to the geneva convention.  and if they were found in a hole then why did you remove from there? and please tell us of the 'intelligence' they supplied the only 'intelligence' they supplied was to be used in how to perfect techniques in torturing in which medical doctors participated just as the doctors in nazi germany. doctors are creepy.
sarc,"his own drummer all right... you might say that the ot god has a bit of a problem upstairs...  funny you should mention lot's wife. lot's family are the sole survivors of the destruction of an entire city, for reasons which are debated. lot's wife is turned into a pillar of salt just because she looked backwards as she was leaving- a natural human response. gen. 19:26 clearly states that she was behind lot. therefore in order to find out what happened to his wife, wouldn't he also had to have looked back? so, anyway, turning around gets you turned into a pillar of salt, but incest is a ok! it must be scary believing in such an inconsistant and crazy god..."
sarc,"ooooo am i supposed to be concerned at anything you have to say? you're a blowhard delusional wannabe christian who doesn't understand your own claimed religion, how can your word hold any meaning."
sarc,i find it funny you think article v was repealed yet the bill of rights references article v for passage.  so we have the bill of rights which can't be repealed but article v which was repealed meaning all the amendments we had are unconstitutional? you've really lost it haven't you. what do you mean 'sos' by the way? save our ship haha? i have been saving your ship.
sarc,"how are you proving that when you have gone out of your way to ignore your failures?  tell me, does comic book art prove creationism? does tv props prove creationism? is oil a hydrocarbon? is density sorting in a fluid medium 'ludicrous?' does a theory that requires miracles work on a scientific level?  how is 'why' the same as 'what?' and since when does grammar depend on the person saying it rather than the statement being said? you claimed that taz did not screw up the grammar, yet i did. yet the statements were identical. how are you addressing what i said when you've completely ignored everything i listed?  more yelling. no actual argument.  the whole point of that was to show you make large numbers of asinine statements. do you reject that?  red bold statements don't make a winning argument."
sarc,"i would agree with you, but first of all, the owner of the show has every right to not allow cameras. second, it would be a huge invasion of privacy if all women knew what their ex wives could keep spying on what they buy and what they do. they have no buisness doing that. very funny, but just because men don't want their rights violated by nosy ex wives and their lawyers and pis, does not mean that they love their guns any more than they do women. its simply a hobby. men don't insist on following women around, watching everything they buy and everything they do, do they? men are entitled to guns just as women are entitled to manicures. our rights are going out the window fast."
sarc,"see, it's fun. finally, some one came to this thread and posted something. i had in mind the song 'hard on me' by asia but oh well. someone finally posted on here besides me and the 'more reference' question from master_shake. now, can someone take my post here and do the exact same thing? i'll use a lot of words so you have stuff to take out and mess with and play around with all you want. so now there is only one question that i have...who's next?"
sarc,"so a ballot initiative that allowed the citizens of the state to vote on the issue was illegal?!?!? what dictatorship do you live in that makes a ballot initiative unconstitutional? oh yeah, i forgot, the district of whatever the poor oppressed gay militants want. so screw the will of the people, just buy the judges and rule through judicial activism."
sarc,that gives no evidence what soever to counter claim his statements he made. instead of lashing out like some self loathing playground bully you actually try for once.... how is he resisting the holy spirit? he is debating scripture in an open minded manner. perhaps seeking to find more truth than fallacy and see the heavy account of personal faith in believing. but no you wouldn't dare to think this would you? you'd rather just scream i'm right! like a ranting child with a tantrum than debate in a methodical manner.... you really bring out the worst in people mr. saint.....
sarc,"Then you should be able to post some numbers that show I am wrong. I had absolutely no problem whatsoever finding and posting numbers that show I am wrong.Whipping? Are you on crack, easy? You and your buddy have been completely smacked down here. You have spewed a bunch of rhetoric and BS and been repeatedly shut down with hard FACT.Why dont you go get a high school diploma so you can at least understand basic math...heck...for that matter, a grade school diploma would ensure you had all the math skills to understand how silly your position is in the face of the facts."
sarc,How many suicide bombers have you herard of wearing a cross? You're assertion is absurd...as usual.
sarc,"That is an interesting fact, how come I have never heard such a thing..maybe a link is in order and not a stormfront or the like link please....actually I have listened to gangsta rap...Easy E, Snoop, NWA, and so many others, in fact they are in my truck right now.. imagine a redhead ""whitey"" takes enjoyment in listening to all kinds of music.. hmm I also have Lady Smith Black Mambazo, Nat King Cole, and while we are at it I have music that I adore from Iran, Iraq, Saudi, Turkey and so many I cant list them all... whats your point?I would hardly call rap the decay of the 90's, apparently a lot of people listen if they are making money....I wonder if you have a crazy relative somewhere in your past? Maybe that would explain a lot."
sarc,"i'm back!! had to re-visit the real world. anyway, how is it that you say i'm confused about my sexuality, because i don't approve of gay marriage?! that is weak! people always claim things like that when they have nothing else to say. i'm straight as hell, and you really don't know me engough to say diffrently. but you on the other hand must be confused."
sarc,"this particular one, formulated the way it is, might well fail. that's why i hope the stupid attorney stops where he is.  where do you get this bizarre idea that the court shies away from 'controversial' issues? ooooo... that's a persuasive legal argument. i'm impressed (not). gay people have been 'earning it' for over 100 years. in the short-term, we may suffer setbacks, in the long-term, there's no stopping us. another unsubstantiated pov that also happens to be untrue. no matter how many times the ditto-heads on the right say it, it remains a fact that the state supreme courts that have recognized the right of same-sex to marry have been dominated by moderate and conservative, republican-appointed judges. of course, they're part of the fading breed of conservatives... the ones who believe in individual rights and freedom."
sarc,"is this the pro-sodomite woman talking here? where does it say in the bible that defending carnal iniquity and sodomy makes one feel squeaky clean like you claim to be?  where does jesus then say that defending carnal iniquity and sodomy is something that he and god approve of? obviously you have created a carnal, iniquity-loving jesus that's different than the jesus of the bible. one more time now, preppy: where does jesus say that defending carnal iniquity and sodomy is something that he and god approve of? got a scripture where he says gay sex sin suddenly became a righteous endeavor? obviously you have created a carnal, iniquity-loving jesus that's different than the jesus of the bible. so go preach that trash to someone who's buying it."
sarc,query: why do they call the followers of gush limpbutt the addict 'dittoheads'? answer: they have no ideas of their own. think gush & cindy have the same supplier?  now there's a capitalist we all can admire!!
sarc,I am not making a mockery of the second ammendment (and so what if I am. Isn't free speech on the first ammendment?). I am actually asking a legitimate question and have yet to have it answered. WHERE DO WE DRAW THE LINE? The second ammendment sheds no light on this. If I was mocking anything it was that you were dodging the question because you want to say no limits although in face of something so obvious you are embarrassed at such a statement.
sarc,"honk! wrong. my parents inherited a house from their parents. they also inherited knowledge and were taught certain values. concepts stored in one brain, expressed via words and encoded in a new brain. epigenetic inheritance, yet still materialistic. doesn't mean they didn't also inherit a bunch of genes, and for the umpteenth time it doesn't mean they get to screw their face up like hiro and tweak them whenever they like. shouldn't i be asking you that, since that's what you say happens, despite having exactly zero evidence to back it up? honk! what a great big fat juicy lie, ss. don't put it in the keep net though; toss it back so you can use it again later."
sarc,would you like some cheese with that whine? emoticonxrolleyes btw this only shows over 60+ years of liberal government incompetence.
sarc,"""while at home"" huh. When did your right to self-defense end at your property line?That is quite a stretch from an old bubble gum chewer even like yourself sliiiick.Thank G-d I live in Texas!!! Those facists states are already failed states so it is semantics anyway when the slaves get restless. criminals are a tyrants wanna be best friend.Everyone should know by now that the cops have no duty to defend anyone no matter the excuses...you are on your own. Everyday I read about the predator leos preying on the electorate so which is worse?"
sarc,"i'll agree with you on some of the things you said, but not the hired gun. america doesn't need to hire guns, we have our own. if what you are asserting is the case, then why would we be where we are right now. and are you saying that israel gets there weapons for free? this is america son, nothing is free if you haven't found out. and our strong ties with israel are more than likely due to the fact that they're more trustworthy than any of the arab nations, thus making a greater ally."
sarc,"I'm not big on the abortion issue, but are you saying that anyone who disagrees with you is sexist and arrogant? That's a tactic straight from the leftist playbook. Clearly you're the one who's arrogant, if you can make these kinds of baseless generalizations of your opponents. Isn't it you who always accuses conservatives of being intolerant of people who think differently than them? Now that's irony!"
sarc,"Well, Jews have always been indecisive. Like this joke says:Q: How many Jews does it take to screw in a light bulb?A: 4; 1 to screw it in and 3 to argue about which way it turns."
sarc,"don't you insult african americans!  i have posted a number of times links and comments by prominant black leaders who infact do support gay marriage. when will you stop your 'don't insult african americans' lies when you know all too well just how wrong you actually are?  oh that's right...never, because you just don't care what anyone thinks if it at all differs from your opinion.  weren't you spanked enough in the 'banned people' forum?"
sarc,"So that's what, at least 4 lies in 8 days? Pretty impressive Archie. You should be on your knees asking god's forgiveness for your lies."
sarc,"so, clive, everyone that believes that god created the earth is an idiot? you need to spend some quality time with some that do and i think you'd change your tune."
sarc,"you mean pascals sucker bet? if arch is wrong, he's wasted a good portion of his life and income catering to a false priesthood, a tick suckling off the fat and meat and marrow of their 'flocks'. he's prevented himself from exploring the wonderful opprotunities this limited life has to offer for the nebulous promises that come after death is assured.  furthermore, he's extolling others to do so also. because misery needs company to justify itself and in insecurity over the rediculous beliefs they hold, they need numbers to validate their wastes and servitude."
sarc,"oh... isn't that just soooo bad??? i mean, after all, brown is such an erudite in this matter, isn't he? his words are just set in stone... he should have just attacked the church and opus dei more so more ignorant people could believe all the xxxx he wrote and be militant atheists without an agenda beyod that of attacking religion. what is it with you and the chuch? do you even know what opus dei is? do you know what it preaches? haven't you no argument that stands on its own, and doesn't need to be founded on some attack on christianity? defend something, don't just attack what you don't comprehend."
sarc,I've got to concentrate...concentrate...concentrate. I've got to concentrate...concentrate...concentrate...Hello?.. .Hello?...Hello? Echo...Echo...Echo...Pinch hitting for Pedro Colon...Manny Mota...Mota...Mota...
sarc,Then why does god order the killing of the unborn in the womb in Hosea 13:16.What did they ever do to god?Does god fear these people so much he has to have unborn members of their community killed. Un born members who couldn't have possibly done anything to god!
sarc,so your saying he was 200% god-man? i'm not a mathematician but that can't be right surley.
sarc,"You of course have documentation of Darwin laying out his plan as to how to weasel evolution into classrooms to oust theism, right? No? You're making it all up? Shocking."
sarc,"how did cjd come about again? i know it had somethig to do with cows and chickens, but i forget the details."
sarc,"and jyoshu is in full cheer-leader mode... what the heck did i supposedly back-peddle on? please. be explicit. no wait. you're not going to answer that, are you... roflmao! symbiote runs around proclaiming all sorts of things (falsely) as my supposed hypothesis, and you pretend that me refusing to take up her strawman approach is somehow 'back-peddling'? more like the blind leading the blind, walking in circles and thinking they are travelling quickly! as for proof, do you understand what 'hypothesis' means in the first place? look it up."
sarc,"what about god? so many god-fearing people, he must be a terrorist :) seriously i really don't know much about terrorists. i know that bin laden was behind 9/11 but he wasn't the only one, but that's about it."
sarc,"Atheism is a religion? Pray tell, where would I find the atheist church?Ridiculous."
sarc,depends on what you mean by 'history'.  did george washington really cut down the cherry tree? that is fiction. did george washington exist? that is documented.. and is history.
sarc,"be sure and count the number of hits vs. the number of misses of some well trained leos. sap, remember your postition you took now on citizens might miss and hit some innocent person? read 3 or 4 versions of this shootout and learn something! lots of useful information in there."
sarc,"Waxy, please read this. Maybe it will help you. When you said the proper way to say it was, ""....tell me I'm wrong, at least do it grammatically."" you made absolutely no sense. Do something grammatically? You obviously have to use grammar when you write a sentence."
sarc,"Now you're just being an butt. The word Dungarees is a coloquialism. Do you know what that word means? Also that's what jeans were called before the word ""jeans' entered the venacular. (Do you know what that word means?) So, now are you going to tell me that only homosexuals have larger vocabularies? Get a life...and preferably not mine...I'm living it at the moment."
sarc,"what? naaah,... all we have to do is deny the suspects are 'persons' then we can do any emoticonxcensored thing we want to with them and there's no moral aspects to it at all,... just like abortion and (at one time) slavery. one thing that has always puzzled me,... 'how is it that enemy combatants and convicted murderous terrorists can come away with more rights and sympathy from the left than a prebirth little human child can?' (scratching head) emoticonxconfused how is it that a leftist can see more outcries for humanity in a whale, dolphin, spotted owl or field mouse than they do in an actual prebirth human child? one of the great mysteries of the modern world, i suppose."
sarc,"Is your thinking really this simplistic? Either I have to agree with you or I am an anarchist? Is that all the complexity you can handle? This or that? Black or white? The best soda in the world is Sprite and everything else is wrong? What a boring little pigeon-holed world you live in.No harm no foul - that is where I stand on sex and romance. Kids, animals and those who don't or can't consent are off-limits. K? Now that I have established (AGAIN) how I feel on that matter, let me reinstate.Any God that allows love and intimacy for only a select group is viscious."
sarc,cant you read? if you are correct this actually supports my point.
sarc,"More chattering from the peanut gallery? Haven't gotten the memo, you're no longer a player? Honestly....clamoring for attention is so low budget. No shame."
sarc,"why would you think such an absurd concept. corporations don't cast a vote in an election do they? why not?  does a corporation have a mind of it's own that it may look to it's interests in it's attempts to influence legislation? no, it permits individuals to overcome finance laws and exercise greater influence than is normally permitted for an individual. should your car have rights? you pay a tax for it. how about your house? pay a tax for that also every year."
sarc,how about when it dawns on you who he was when he came the first time? lol! trade in your blinders for some spiritual light!
sarc,"that i later 'concede' in a pm? you mean despite the fact that probably coming up on a dozen times now i have told you premises represent evidence and you decided that the last time i told you this was a concession.... what do you think a 'logical premise' is? show me denying that i said a. i'll be honest i have no way to prove otherwise because proof relies on logic. of course there is an objective truth here, i can illustrate the contradiction inherent in false logic using the real world; but if you don't accept that contradiction is unacceptable...."
sarc,"No more of a poison than alcohol (actually far less), should we start lacing that with strychnine? ***I can see it now****Excuse me bartender...what are the drink specials?-We got Bud Light bottles for $4.00, Jagerbombs for $7.50, and this new drink called Convulsions on the Beach. First one is on the house!"
sarc,and you don't think 9/11/01 was and attack on this country huh? emoticonxrolleyes  you are exactly the kind of liberal carl rove was talking about in his speech the other day.......
sarc,"so you agree simple foreknowledge is not determinism in the way i explained it? if so, can you explain that to electrolyte, who is having a terrible time coming to grips with that? he has omnipotent foreknowledge about future events, is the way i would put it."
sarc,"are you telling me that my pubes are sentient? i agree, however i am no constitutional expert."
sarc,"i can't believe he used that on me. just goes to show that he will mimic not only preachers but any one else that he thinks will make him look good at the time. ez why don't you stop this?? people will actually converse with and discuss things that you feel are important if you would only think for yourself. forget the dogma,.. forget the spoon feed interpetations of a dusty old book and think for yourself. people will actually begin to take you seriously."
sarc,"What facts? The article above your post is replete with documented facts. Are you in denial? Have you even read the article? Are all of your responses knee-jerk, shoot-from-the-hip defense mechanisms?Pay attention."
sarc,I have an entire New Testament. You've got what - a mouthful of denial? When you get to the level of the NT works let us know.
sarc,"and your kids go to private school yes? so you want higher teen pregnancy, more abortions and more sexually transmitted diseases?  if you are disagreeing with my statement that you want all of those lower, then you are admitting you either want them to increase or stay the same. as you have railed against abortion, it would appear you're being contradictory. make up your mind. and yet they have lower rates. funny how that works.  no. in the seven years since introduction 620,000 or so european women have used it. so that's around 88,000 abortions a year. 1.2 million happen in the us annually. as the population of europe is around the same as the us, it's not a valid point. 88k to 1.2 million is nothing.  plan b isn't abortion. try me."
sarc,** This is the best response you've got!?! What a loser!!
sarc,"uhm, you do realize that humans and chimps are not the same things as dogs, cats, horses, and sharks ... right?  i am under no obligation to address the evolutionary origin every possible organism. let's review the facts. 1) i said there is a ton of evidence for macroevolution, and there is.  2) i gave a specific example, saying that i could provide multipe lines of independent evidence supporting the fact that humans and chipms share a common evolutionary ancestor. and i can."
sarc,"parents want convenience and to pacify their children with a 'happy meal'. most kids don't ask for lettuce, they ask for burgers. wonder why mcdonalds doesn't add a soy burger to their menu? they have salads and adding soy products would be another way to show they 'care' about health. the answer might be they have done consumer research and found the costs to create/market a new soy product outweight the profits."
sarc,"so what is it that isn't true? are you saying nasa didn't spend 12 billion dollars developing a zero gravity pen or that russia didn't use a pencil? and since you're so anal about a simple joke, go ahead and support your claim that anything my joke says isn't true, with actual evidence. your opinion doesn't carry much weight with me."
sarc,"Hey, have you printed your name on the inside waistband of you dungarees yet so when you pull your head out from where the sun don't shine you'll know who the heck you are? How many times do you need to be told....GAYS HAVE CHILDREN...MY SON IS PROOF ENOUGH."
sarc,"you're right. god hates fags, dontcha know? it's not like hiv can be contracted by heterosexuals or anything."
sarc,"ooh lucy herself. so tell me, just out of curiosity, how do they know how much hair to put on her life size image? i notice she isn't that furry at all. how'd they figure that out from just a few bones? let's see, what do they call people like you at the carnival booths? oh that's right, an easy mark. have you read any other good fairy tales lately pandion, besides lucy that is."
sarc,"hmm so all you guys have achieved is make a bad situation in iraq infinitely worse and you ask the reasons why the whole world hate you? go to iraq and ask the people there what do they think of you and take the whole class with you including the teacher. so how would you reign in the militias, what is your method the world would probably not approve of?"
sarc,"WW, are you talking to yourself?If not, then please learn how to attribute statements to the person who made them."
sarc,"if something is modified, does it not become better, or more complex? there's nothing wrong with those terms, unless you're a degreed scientist who is talking down to common peasants.  all .00001% of them? you're not the only one i debate. emoticonxidea  does talkorigins have one? they are used as a reference here constantly - i don't think the asa has been referred to a single time, until now.  talkorigins feedback section supports my position."
sarc,i will ask you yet again who these nefarious 'gay lobbist' are that you continually refer to? how do you define 'lobbist'. merriam-webster on line dictionary http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=lobbyists are you not yourself a 'lobbyist'? many times one thinks of a lobbyist as one who is paid to present a particular point of view. with that in mind: 1) are you receiving wages during the time you spend reading and posting on this forum? i am not. 2) is the person or organization paying you those wages aware of the nature your activities here in this forum? 3) does the person or organization paying you those wages advocate the nature of your opinions and activities expressed here in this forum? 3) are you using equipment or facilities provided by some other person or organization to read and make postings here?
sarc,business is a purely private association. you mean like interracial marriage? 'social harm' is just another term for 'things i personally find distasteful'.
sarc,so you are happy that they chopped of the most sensitive part of your penis? that someone took and cut out a part of your body without your consent? what if it where your nipples? after all nipples on men serve no purpose.
sarc,"are you completely incapable of making sense? penfold used deliberately obtuse language. this language was then explained to you. now you are arguing that 'turn the other cheek' is completely different, and in no way similar, to 'revolve/rotate' the other cheek. if you turn something, you revolve or rotate it. you're so busy being affronted by what people say that you come off as even more simple than they try to make you appear."
sarc,"and what are the choices of the so called 'pro-life' people? suffer through a rape or incest induced pregnancy, die from pregnancy complications without a chance of terminating it, or force women who took proper precautions which failed to go through an unwanted pregnancy while likely losing her job, scholarships, any chance at life, etc. some great choices there emoticonxrolleyes i'd swear the whole group of them have an underlying misogynistic syndrome."
sarc,But you said that you saw standing aside whilst someone murdered another was cowardly? ::sigh::Let me simplify for you. Do you kill someone to prevent a murder?
sarc,1) why is the philosophy of jefferson twisted?? if you can't say its because you are a typical anti american liberal. 2) nothing to suppoprt it? if anti-american liberal positions were made illegal as per the constitution then everyone would have to vote among the conservatives.  the political spectrum would simple shift so that both extremes were in the intelligent range. on the far left you'd have romney and on the far right you'd have ron paul. now that would be an intelligent election consistent with our very very conservative constitution.
sarc,but they lack evidence as to why a first trimester fetus should be considered a 'being'. they want to change the law based on metaphysical claims attached to their religion. why don't we make it illegal to work on sunday while we're at it. and why not saturday too? and enough with the bacon already (just for good measure).
sarc,"how many counts would a recount count if a recount could count counts? a recount would count all the counts that count, but the recount may not count."

sarc,"sure. god commanded faithfulness in marriage. yet he never even raised an eyebrow at abraham inpregnating his maid, and went on to bestow blessings on him like it never happened. god commanded you should not steal. yet moses' brilliant idea of having the israelites borrow gold and jewelry from the egyptians they knew they never were going to repay seemed mildly humorous to god at the time. god commanded that noone should make graven images of him or anything in heaven. so what's the deal with the ark of the covenant? and the number of instances god commanded his people to kill, shortly after commanding them not to kill, well this could become a pretty long post.  i know you asked for one, but i just started rambling because so many came to mind. pick one if you want."
sarc,"Oh, EZ, so this god of yours wants to see ME, does he?Well and good. Because when I have access to that god he is going to get an earful from me about how his people have screwed over the world."
sarc,"i have no reason to believe it's false, and reason to believe it is true. relax ladies and gentlemen, that test of the find-a-cook system passed with flying colours. you're having trouble understanding english again, maybe you should hire a translator? if it is not a crime then it cannot be an accusation, and is likely a fact."
sarc,me whine?  this entire f ing thread is devoted to you whining. go cry to your mommy about all those big bad gay people picking on you and your poor little religion.
sarc,"greetings? these day here abouts, which are these internet forums the plentifully existing posters, nature robots are inside. only early did today deliberator form notes on estland! few can be interested it, little the posters here in such goings on.  he spoke that about the country, again in tremendous fascism descends and asks for people of the sympathetic consideration to resist it. so the surplus, which, swollen high flown long eye is burned through, is typical from its ilk, without direction of the delimitation and the little direction. i hope that you have in enjoyed this of her one of small language in the answer of cheek, nevertheless that the a lot of praise for this prosa extraordinary should go babelfish!"
sarc,"Aww, you didn't read a top criminoligist I quoted before did you?The ""Myth"" of Gun TraffickingYou also didn't check out mexidata.com either did you?Now you need proof to back up your alligator mouth. Where's the beef sliiiiick?"
sarc,"i must admit i was a bit confused when you came out with this: where in this discussion did i offer any solution to zimmerman (i don't remember mentioning him at all)? nor did i give any suggestion as to what i would do. so where did this 'both of you' come from? please could you also point out where i interjected pepper spray into the debate? a quote would be nice. oh, and the term 'enemy combatants' was just made up so that the bush and his partners in crime could get round international law. the geneva convention does cover them very clearly in the quote i gave."
sarc,"Well, good, I'm glad as heck you have a mom you can tell that to. Mine would've hit the roof, and then hit me on the way back down. Did she flip or was she pretty cool about it?Just remember (who would we be if not preachy? Us ol' adults, we don't know nuthin') that b.c. isn't one hundred percent reliable or that condoms can break and you can still get nasty bugs all kinds of different ways."
sarc,"So if a jew tells a big nose joke, he's saying that all jews have big noses? This is a joke thread; I posted a joke, get over it."
sarc,"let's look up all the definitions, shall we? here's where you got 'yours': as you can see, the definition you cited is only used once, and even then it is just one of two from that source.  i notice you ignored all of the responses to you on the thread and decide to just post this piece of work without answering people. we are waiting, oh sentient one. we have shown you creatures that match all of these definitions (or at least all of the definitions that are seen in each and every source - see how alike each one is?) - now show us how humans are the only sentient beings in the universe."
sarc,"your ""minds""? How many do you have? Oh, and ""I wanted to see what inferior it was""? Nice example of your supposed superiority."
sarc,"but do you ever question it for your self? or are you content to just show up .. and let someone else tell you what it all means. the rcc has made , by their own admission, mistakes in the past are you suggesting that it won't happen again? are you suggesting they never made a mistake in their interpitation of the bible? if so you might want to tell that to gallileo remember him ? he was burned at the stake for telling the rcc that the earth went around the sun!"
sarc,he screamed and insulted and threw his literature at the vice president of pride. and you once again snipet and reword my posts by taking them out of context to serve your own irrational and bigoted thought process. oh and dont accuse your community? what are you some holy leader? get off of your self rightous high horse and get a clue! and how is my community rising above your 'communities' bigotry and and slander? by having pride movements like these and standing up for ourselves.
sarc,"you are attempting to trivialize the bias we who are gay, face, against our sexuality. you try to trivialize everything we have accomplished in terms of social acceptance, that heterosexuals have always taken for granted. your assinine comments show sensitivity to no one. maybe you'd like to start a pride movement for ignorant, insensitive, jackasses? society is moving so against that group right now."
sarc,"funny how all those previously plentiful miracles, burning bushes, and personal appearances dropped off so suddenly 2000+ years ago... innit? enquiring minds want to know. non-enquiring minds don't want to enquire."
sarc,"then you would want me to be something god did not create me to be? silly, i 'd say! humans are part of the animal kingdom. mammals if i remember from biology. are you not an animal? if not, maybe the mothership will come and pick you up soon."
sarc,i doubt you know enough about carl bogus speedy defense of bellesiles and his dependance on a flawed study by loftin which was also in turn defended by jack rakov who later apologized out of embarrasment? want to take a shot and drag this farther off topic and embarrass yourself and star gazer and any other adherents? you well know you are in the wrong ballpark as has been pointed out many times on this very board. keep clutching at straws you will never get enough to build that strawman. beating a dead horse is bad enough...all 9 justices agreed the right was individual in heller.
sarc,"What the heck did you have for breakfast today, huh? A bowl of nails and terpentine to wash it down? Talk about a foul mood. You've been to half a dozen threads just this morning launching personal attacks at everybody you come across, and most of them have something to do with 'I'm glad there aren't more people in the world like you,' or 'I hope you're the only ones the terrorists kill so we can get back to making this nation great,' blah blah blah. They invented things like Midol for moods like yours.Just because someone doesn't agree with you doesn't make them stupid, or misguided, or immoral, or dishonest, or any of the other snipes you've been firing off. Lol, and you're telling me to not throw any hissy fits."
sarc,poet i found it interesting your illutration of the 'matirx' series. i too have seen the two episodes and found it filled with religious overtones. i dont know the faith of the wachaski brothers but there story is intreging. all mankind decived by this lifstyle which as seen from reality is merely a save to produce power. much like mankind is decived by satan today. a select group of people who believe that a savior wil come to free man kind from this savery. even those who have seen the truth and reject it. this sounds alot like the account of the bible. i want so much to see the final episode to find if the theme continues. will neo's death be that which saves all mankind? we will wait and see.
sarc,Ala San Francisco values by Nancy Pelosi and that crowd? God help us!
sarc,"Are you being dense on purpose? I said that I'm not all into the semantics of baby/fetus. I'll conceid that its killing a baby. The TERM for it is fetus, fetus' become babies. I see the logic there (in fact I think I'm agreeing with you). Why must you keep pounding this drum?"
sarc,"Where did you here this XXXX?Some cheap detective novel or something?Once again, my sincerest apologies."
sarc,"a majority of the planet believes in a higher power, so i allready have the majority agreement on this. how about you come up with a test to see if god doesnt exist... well? i'm waiting."
sarc,You're somehow right despite the fact that all reliable evidence is on our side? What idiocy.
sarc,"Have you EVER read anything that Dawkins wrote? Any of his books? Now didn't you tell me that I shouldn't be so ""self-confident"" about the Bible because you thought that I hadn't read it? Can you spell hypocrisy? I knew you could."
sarc,lol...well why don't you use your brain and tell me how and why breasts formed then. why would they get selected for in the first place? ns can't see into the future. have any evidence of a reptile with breasts?
sarc,"uh. no. that isn't what he said. why do you misrepresent what he said? why are you lying so much? every time you lie like that, jesus kills a kitten."
sarc,"When you are menstruating, do you make sure you don't touch anyone so that you don't make them ""unclean""? If not, you better start."
sarc,"the 'city' huh? same one same all. we know who to sue for attempting to infringe on a fundamental right now don't we. who hired the investigators besides the mayor? nice try sparky. oooooh, kroll has deep pockets too. l00k at the board of directors and the usual suspects. misapplication of funds too huh?"
sarc,"ok, fine, you can use that line, but there is also a moajority that believes in other things. there's this crazy thing, called a choice. we all have that. remember? i made the choice to have sex, you're making the choice to be a total ***hole. we all make a decision, and its the strong ones that stick with them, even though there are others who dont believe the same thing."
sarc,"Stalin died of natural causes while in power, I believe. Perhaps the fall of communism is due in part that the purges stopped. So, killing hundreds of thousands of people was wise for Stalin, huh? Good. Good. Anybody disagree with canadianman76?"
sarc,"you're right justine. organized religion has always been used by some people as crutch in order to feel superior to others. why use your brain and heart if you don't have to? because they are encouraged by their particular religion to behave this way, they think it's 'morally' alright. 'sickening' is a good way to put it."
sarc,"no reply bassman? seriously mate, i can understand why some people on this forum have a problem with you, you can't just go around posting total lies! you are a sensible guy, for the most part, lets have some reasonable arguments as oppose to mindless bigotry."
sarc,"you do know that it is a) easy to register and b) the site admin is a christian, don't you? you won't go there because the moderation is strict about sticking to the topic and insults. these things seem to be part of your weapon load out, here."
sarc,"yeah a spending problem increasing our deficit by 800 billion  dollars by not taxing the muckety mucks that outsource american jobs to china. oh and where is this borrowed revenue coming from to lets the super rich get a break? china. what are the walton's the owners of wal mart getting by this deal? a 32 billion dollar tax break! i wonder what we could do with 32 billion dollars hmm? you think their going to increase employee wages? healthcare? pump it back into the economy? hell no.... what a scandle. it's the end of this country as we flippin know it people and personally it makes my stomach hurl. go ahead easy. beg the walton's for your lost job back, or your wages, or to pay for your kids books out of charity when the state funds run dry.... go ahead and beg...."
sarc,"Okay, so if we only need 10 laws then they must be, without any doubt, the 10 most important rules possible that would serve mankind throughout history. Not coveting your neighbor's oxen made the list? Why is not creating any graven images more important than not enslaving people? That didn't even make the list. If those 10 things were all that God intended to impart on mankind I have to question his mental competance."
sarc,"could it be that they've finally realized that there is no viable argument for gun control in a country that was built on freedom to bear arms? each time the control-lobby comes up with an argument....they get shot to pieces. (laugh out loud!) it is interesting to note that both of the democratic front-runners for 2008 favor gun control. with the recent death of charlton heston, there's a weakness in the armor of the nra. i would go on a handgun buying spree, but i already have enough guns and ammo to stave off a thousand or so government guntakers at a place we call 'the little alamo'."
sarc,is it only the spiritually blind that can see guys like this for what they really are? rip preacher.
sarc,"Ah, so when I lobby for burets for my chemistry classes, I'm indoctrinating my kids into the evils of iodometry? *gasp*Yes, it's a stupid as it sounds, because it's analogous to your argument."
sarc,"Lemme guess, in real life you're a lawyer, correct? You must be because you're extremely hypertechnical to the point of absurdity. It doesn't matter what you call them, be it criminal or gang member of dope dealer or home invader, if somebody breaks the law then they're a criminal and it's as simple as that.Seriously dude, you're trying to get off on a technicality here. Like a lawyer trying to argue ""Your honor my client isn't a prostitute, she's a female escort"". Doesn't matter what you call it or what you try to pass it off as, a criminal is a criminal regardless of what their formal title is.So which is Ripskar, do criminals have guns and are likely to shoot you in the face and kill you, or do they not have guns at all. It's one or the other, it can't be both."
sarc,"if liars go to hell, and it turns out there is no god afterall and youve been lying this whole time, would you go to hell or would you not, because hell obviously doesnt exist in this situation? bennedict: making your life complicated for fun since 2010."
sarc,"Are you suggesting the pollsters are bias? Nooooooooooo, that couldn't be. You think they were trying to sway the election? Noooooooooo, that couldn't be. These guys along with their Hollywood and music industry buddies are lossing their base. They need to go back to movies and music and leave the politics alone."
sarc,"why should a mere little baby have to earn the love of its parents? good god! what kind of parenting is that? i will love you, my child, if you deserve my love."
sarc,...but you are just fine with marijuana smoke huh?I am working on the assumption that you run home to tell mommie or you run to find your teacher and report it immediately. Midgets like you got to have some backup.How and why do you always change the subject? Can't take the heat? Do you ever read headers?You got a mouth on you as big as grand canyon.
sarc,"'blah blah blah'? look, you weighed in here on what i said, making an issue of whether it was internal, empatically making a point that it was action. as i said, i'm basically agreeing with you on the whole thing here about there needing to be equality in this situation, so i don't know why you're being so eager to find something to disagree over here."
sarc,"I'm going to ask you a direct question, which I am sure you will ignore.John is an atheist.He has stolen some money. He is sincerely remorseful over his actions.Since John is remorseful, has your Judeo-Christian God FORGIVEN John?You can ""blah, blah, blah"" all you want, but a ""yes"" or a ""no"" needs to be given EXPLICITLY in your answer."
sarc,"they must suffer terribly in the deep snows of the canadian winter, eh? no wonder they're pouring south over the border. little emoticonxcensored ers."
sarc,"what kind of question is that? we can't have true freedom until dissenters have been hunted down and killed, or tossed into th gulag...er, i mean, prison, for demonstrating their dissent."
sarc,"pay attention to what ? to the voices in your head ? your age is irrelevant to your recognized lack of intelligence, but being a minor would be relevant since it would excuse your ignorance.My advice to you ?keep all your life pretending in forums that you are just a kindergarten kid and therefore people would think that for a 4 year old kid you are not too dumb and of course knowing nothing is understandable."
sarc,a double helping of insulting spam? i'm honoured....emoticonxgood how interesting that you selectively belittle crick's comments on panspermia while lauding his debunked tornado in a junkyard conjecture.
sarc,"another question that shouild be answered is . . . if the bible says that noah and a few members of his family were the only ones to survive this 'global' flood, how come there are so many other accounts of others surviving a flood? did god miss the target (that being the whole of humanity)? genesis 6:13 (new international version) 13 so god said to noah, 'i am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. i am surely going to destroy both them and the earth. presumably he also knew from the beginning of time that he was going to make this great big ####-up. how embarrassing!"
sarc,"Calling someone a ""liar"", ""fool hardy"", ""[corrupter] of the truth"", and unobjective is considered complimentary where you come from? Odd, but OK, I'll go with it you lying brainwashed fool (hey, this is fun! I like using Archie's compliments!).Actually, my ""sick hypothetical"" was a very valid question. I simply asked you if god commanded you to kill your neighbour for his sins, sins which you had no evidence of, would you do it. It seems like a fairly simple, straightforward question to me. Why not answer it?I see a pattern here Archie. If someone asks you a tough question about your faith, you cry ""Corrupter! Blasphemer!"" and run away. Is this your idea of ""witnessing""? Is your faith that weak? Answer my simple little question, then I will answer the same one, or another of your choosing if you'd like. Tit for tat."
sarc,"like in afghanistan? hopefully it will go a little better with this puppet, his own bodyguard was the latest in a slew of assasination attempts."
sarc,"orion's follies: some other goodies from that site... never linked to those specific articles.  but before orion gets too self-righteous, let's look at some ot the topics he considered 'funny' in a link he gave over at the usat creation / evolution forum: christian crimes - pastor molests widow's boys - pastor molests adopted daughters - priest molests altar boys - late for church - christian racist kidnapper - music pastor molests - bush's faith-based failure - pastor molest, guns, drugs - $400,000 missing - priest molests - church youth coach molests - bush suppresses student prayer - sen byrd's 'white ('n' word)'  is this funny? it's apparently real funny to orion. his link also had a pornographic sub-link on the virgin mary, describing her in graphic, profane language.  orion - christ-deniers like you and brummer need a lot of help."
sarc,"Oh, now you've got Obama leaving a mess in your hole, and James Carville blasting your hole (Spicy Cajunspunk)?Now Bubba's not so sure about wanting to plug/plough your hole. Boy you really do get around, EZ. That hole must be pretty wide and loose."
sarc,"So you think it is a good idea for public schools to assume the role of parents? Perhaps you would support a balance then. Given what you say here, you wouldn't think it a bad idea for the New Hampshire School System to take a field trip to the local Catholic church would you? You know, so kids can know what resources, agencies, and organizations are available to them in the event that they may need to interact with them in the future.The School Board apparently gets the message, however. According to the article, it has instructed school administrators to investigate the matter, and determine whether disciplinary action is necessary. I would think it is."
sarc,"Let's see now....you're Christophobic, Biblephobic, Fundie-phobic, steeped in carnal hedonism, you use derogatory rhetoric against God's people, and what else?Hypocrite!!And Barney Franks a respectable congressman? ROTFLOL!!!!You're clueless, Shooter. I shutter to think where you'll wind up. But we'll have to see what develops. It'll probably be negative, since you've lost your focus."
sarc,"it must because he's a liberal. hey sarah, how come bushie's daddy, cheney, and rumsfeld all used to rub elbows with saddam? must be cause they were led astray by some liberal..."
sarc,"they sure do, and make sure that there are all those women priests and women cardinals that have a say in the politics of the church. when they sealed the room to choose this current pope, how many women were in that room? when they were discussing the publication of the last catchiesm, how many women participated? it's easy to pray to a non-corporial image, because that image won't talk back and heavens forbid, give an opinion."
sarc,"just because an admin hasnt noticed, that means you are right? boy, thats some thinking right there. chill out. we can have a civilized debate, or we can try to act like were in 8th grade gym class. your choice."
sarc,"what are you talking about?!?! the constitution was written in the late 1700's we have to go by thier meaning not a modern interpretation, this is most silly. as for your quote on adams i do not see how that even remotley applies to this discussion... care to expound?"
sarc,oh? what keeps you from having 6 or eight or for that matter having crossed bandoleers across the chest? i suspect kalifornia law will be changed a bunch and one in the pipe will be in vogue as well as a loaded mag in the gun for utility sake. you wouldn't want the perp to be disadvantaged too much now would you? how many shots must one allow the perp before you can fire back?
sarc,"so now name calling and accusations as to my mental health are what you concider as rational thought?  i expect that you must be some sort of expert on warfare, in paticular this war? am i to believe that you are a soldier there now?  your rage towards me in your post only shows just how easily upset you are. i posted exactly what i meant to and you went off on a tangent. i asked you for proof and all you can do is a schoolyard tactic if 'show me yours before i show mine?' pitiful."
sarc,WOO HOO.So the main stream entertainment industry who brought us such great talent as Brittney Spears does not consider this film the cats meow? WEE HA - all the more reason to see it.
sarc,"hey, archangel, i notice you didn't respond to the points i made - no argument, huh? to quote jyoshu: 'well since you didn't address my points, i'll assume you're done! a simple 'ok, i concede that ... and moving on back to the issues ...' ***jyoshu well, everyone, looks like our ez/ss clone has finally realized his argument was wrong."
sarc,"yeah, you are right dono.....so explain to me about the constitution??? would you like to start with the federalist papers and move on from there? i have yet to hear someone prove me wrong on the constitution. if you think that the cruel and unusual term doesn't apply to the living constitution then you are sadly mistaken. how do you think it became that the death penalty for minors is illegal now? the court 15yrs ago said differently!!! how can the inerpretation change with no basis other then ones own personal opinion? this is scary..people, you gotta think this stuff through!"
sarc,"but wouldnt it mean that if she (if phunting is female) burns in hell, that would mean that god really exists. do you believe in god? also, do you think that if god really does exists that he's just bluffing about that hell stuff? hmmmm..."
sarc,"Who is Allah, Alex? Great, I'll take 'things a terrorist god would do' for $1600 Alex."
sarc,"yeah, ez is what will come back to haunt you. hay ez you know why i can say anything i want about jesus with out consequence? it's because jesus never existed. sleazy, when are you going to grow up?"
sarc,"or get a hybrid. or carpool.  but it is quite impossible to reason financially with one who holds the most idiotic of fisical ideas.  it still amuses me that vor thinks a cd during low inflation is a good idea. hey, why is it that vor has cowardly fled from virtually every argument i met him in? btw vor, everytime you say something that is just financially idiotic, i'm going to bring up the cd comment."
sarc,"You mean to tell me that you would deny a woman's right to her own body for a zygote, yet you have no problem murdering real human beings? Sounds like a conservative to me..."
sarc,"and mythology. you forgot mythology. for example, the two stories of creation were probably two popular folk myths. and the story of the flood is actually two versions of the myth that are intermixed. and, of course, the stories of job and of jonah are pure mythology. do you know what logic is? comparing the moral mythology of noah to a parable is an analogy, not logic. the myths of noah are not history. and since we are talking about noah, i see you bailed on the thread where the pyramids of egypt were being discussed. and yet you refer to this obvious myth as history."
sarc,"like i said in another thread, the argument i hear most often from so-called 'pro-choicers' is that you cannot legislate morality. well then what can you legislate? every law in existence is legislation of morality! by that way of thinking, then we should have no laws. if someone kidnaps and murders your 3-year-old child, then let's hope the murderer goes free because we cannot legislate morality!"
sarc,"are you illiterate or just stupid? when you try to use biblical passages dishonestly and out of context in order to convince people that god would favor an economy without social programs when, in fact, the exact opposite is clearly true, then you have perverted the word of god in the service of selfishness and greed. this aint hard."
sarc,"so have the trillions of dollars that have already been 'redistributed upward' since the reagan/gramm deregulation mania helped end poverty? or has it created a dependent class of ultra rich people unable to function without a taxpayer bailout? that sword, my shonda friend, cuts both ways."
sarc,"shall we regress to babble?  the government is already heavily into the term 'marriage'. not only the us government, but governments all over the world refer to 'marriage' as the legal union of a man and a woman. changing the definition in one country would likely create confusion everywhere.  what if some countries required you to clarify whether you were married to a man or a woman in order to get a visa? do we need to define several types or classes of 'married couple'. what if some countries objecting to the concealment of the gender of one's spouse instituted a death penalty for it? i would argue that legally joined same-sex couples should have all the benefits and rights afforded married couples, but not for redefining 'marriage' solely for the purpose of calling them such."
sarc,"are you one of the hard of understanding people? flyboy got it, even if his rationalisations were insufficient. even so, they were far superior to much of the dross you regurgitate."
sarc,"Spanking doesn't teach children to defend themselves against violence. It teaches them the exact opposite because they are forced to submit to these acts of violence *and* they are told it's being done out of love. Do you ever wonder what conditions some women and men to accept violence from their partner? Do you ever wonder how they could not recognize it as abuse? I'll give you three guesses. Different personalites process and categorize information in different ways. Unfortunately for many children, this is one of them. :( And unfortunately I'm speaking from experience."
sarc,and i am a clump of human cell with shoes on...what is your point? no. you seem to refuse the idea that 'human' as a noun is used to describe a human being meaning the entity as a whole and not the individual cells that make it up. i am sorry you don't understand this but the word means what it means. i find it odd that you even care what you call a fetus anyway. your sperm is a human now? you should invest in a biology book.
sarc,to take the pis out on others? seems like the thing to do. if you're here to learn...consider your teachers... there are more effective means of acquiring knowledge and insight than to sit around and gab with your mentally defective peers.
sarc,"making sweeping judgments against homosexuals and atheists, with no real knowledge of their situation? archie has no problem. but when it comes to christianity, the obfuscational ploy of 'i don't know all the details' comes out, followed promptly by a thorough lack of concern for finding out any additional details. she is blatantly violating her religion in doing so. the bible lays out exclusive reasons for 'divorce'. this isn't one of them. this is yet another example of religious intolerance, even to the extent of violating their own religion."
sarc,"You assume homosexuality is a ""choice"", with no evidence substantiating that position, until you have been shown evidence that it is genetic???And you claim to be a ""scientist by profession""???LOLOLOLOL!While you're at it, maybe you can explain to us what a ""unconscious choice"" is..."
sarc,"Ah, so we shouldn't get all stirred up because little girls are singled out for slaughter?Please excuse me for having misplaced priorities."
sarc,"where did that happen, in your dreams? please note the word ' extreme'. extreme lefties have been just as blood thirsty as extreme righties."
sarc,"they weren't interested, remember? so your god punishes children for not being a member of the right 'club'. your god sounds more and more like a monster every time you mention him. once again, like with archie i have been wrong to assume you a bigot, you're a xenophobe."
sarc,What about people who believe in something so much they are willing to suffer - even die - for it? I thought you Christians were really into that kind of thing! emoticonXAngel I ask because the history of the Documentary Hypothesis is filled with those who were persecuted for daring to suggest that evidence led away from the tradition that Moses had written the entire Pentateuch. Another case of the church strangling free thought!
sarc,you kidding? ez can't see past the front of his cobwebbed skull.
sarc,"Hey that would be great. The law would FORCE all anti-gunners of military service age and ability to own a fully automatic rifle. The law would FORCE all anti-gunners to train with the weapon. The law would FORCE VOR to keep his rifle clean. Hey VOR how about it? Keep your rifle clean or go to jail. I'm not talking about my rifle, I'll be glad to keep my free government rifle clean. How about you?"
sarc,"none of them which are correct.  how about you address my points? oh wait, you won't because you need to maintain your fantasy land where everyone who disagrees with you is an atheist.  how can you attack me when you won't even read the links given to you?"
sarc,"Three days? Non Christians supposedly spend an eternity in hell, not the weekend."
sarc,"You have no Idea how glad I was that I was sitting down when I read this!!First it shocks me that you haven't labeled all those who claim to see UFO's liberals.Then I have to wonder didn't at one time the RCC say we were the center of the universe,... The sun went around the earth,... the earth was flat ?? Theres no one but us .. It was all created for us??Ok I'm goning to go take a little breath of fresh air and rest for a moment as this is very disturbing to me! .... V.O.R. and I agree on something. I think I'm going to be sick!! Back in a few."
sarc,"oh hank, you really are funny. the way you are changing. i simply made a statement that it was one of many posts that you have agreed on. that was the post you disputed. are you still near all those paint-fumes? it must be the rotational affect of the egg-shaped world you live on! :) as i said... how simple is that? it is one that you've agreed on, and you now agree that it's one of several that you've agreed on. what is your point?  i made a statement that you now agree on. you raised an objection, you even say that everyone knows what you said, excepting me. how have i demonstrated i don't understand you? i haven't disputed your original statement. i made a complimentary statement."
sarc,Not even let white people in? I can imagine why your teacher suggested a reality check.
sarc,"my hat is off to california! was my post #43 right or wrong? now we just need new york to follow suit. now my question. if the federally funded programs can not create new stem cell lines, can california create them and then share? voila! federal funding on useful research. then watch 'em all stand in line for the cure. another question. has anybody else thought to ask gwb why, if stem cell research is false hope, did he fund any of it -- badly?"
sarc,"what are you? nuts? you know that in our 'gun free' society, you are more likely to be a victim of violent crime, armed robbery or homicide than you were before the howard government tightened the gun laws? i mean, you know we are less safe now, right? but hey, at least we can rest easy knowing people are only be being bashed and stabbed to death, rather than shot. god bless australia, huh?"
sarc,do you go to study hall? probably not. It is a requirement where the athletes sign in and sit in the library with their teams and are monitored to make sure that their studying is getting done.
sarc,"Ever hear of artificial ensemination? Why is that heteros only think there is one way to produce children? I find hetero sex disturbing,and an unnatural lifestyle choice."
sarc,"typical pro-life, woman-hating schmuck. i am pro-choice so i must be selfish whore who aborts all the time. you aren't worth the energy it takes to type.  i'm sure its no greater than your own. i mean, only a scarred woman could want autonomy, right? real women should be door mats, that way you don't ever have to attempt being a real man. way way over the line. he is an amazing, committed, loving, amazing father. maybe you, like my ex-husband, think being father is about who you ####. and like him, you probably think thats also where it ends as well. both myself and my son's adopted (real) father have higher standards than that."
sarc,"trebor - it's humerous to watch your denial mechanism work overtime, trebor. for the 3rd of 4th time, where in your tanakh does it say your animal sacrifices for sin were abolished? shouldn't you be out trying to find a nice young lamb or ram for slaughter? lol!"
sarc,So your claim that no pre-existing belief is necessary is untested by you. Do you have an example of an actual non-believer having a religious experience that made a believer of them? In my experience God never appears to atheists. Funny that.
sarc,"archie, that wasn't a prophecy you neo marxist socialist, it was a hope. neo, marxist socialist, eh? three compliments in the same sentence. see you can be nice if you really really try. nice to know i am continuing the proud tradition that my parents established so many years ago. my father voted for debs, and my mother voted for foster. archie, sweetie, your flattery will get you nowhere, try as you might."
sarc,"yes. your point? have you? as poor a typist as i am, and as full of mis-spellings as most of my posts are that is the best you can do? i must be slipping."
sarc,"Now settle down charlie, and try to think rationally, just for a second. Have you ever heard of a tumor growing into a sentient life form as a fetus does? I'd appreciate a link documenting such an occurrence so we pro-lifers can start planning save the tumor rally's."
sarc,Is North Korea a bastion of peace and good-living? Nope. Is it religious? Nope. Therefore obstacles to 'peace' don't necessarily have to be tied in with religiosity.Hope that's spelt out enough for you. Try to keep up.
sarc,"my hate of iniquity vs. your love for it? get a new dog, brummer."
sarc,Contradict what? Thank you for acknowledging that I know what I'm talking about. I call it questioning. You call it wrangling because you've no coherent thoughts of your own.
sarc,Obviously sarcasm escapes you....if you did not understand that remark about gun control working in Europe during the 1930's.Report me? My knees are trembling already.I believe Steeve was expressing his right to free speech.
sarc,"You would not celebrate Osama being out of the picture? Maybe not throw a party, but a not even a simple ""yippee!""? Yeah, right. What a load."
sarc,"but to some it is the word of their god. you see? you have no god so you dont have to worry (at least not yet). and 'divine', so you are saying besides sarcastic rhetoric that they were divinely inspired cause you labled them that. sears is now jcpenney's get with the times. and no it wouldnt be hung there cause you can tbuy drapes in revelation. fiction: archaeologival evidence is fiction? sick: yes soddom and ghamorah was a sad story. dangerous: yes to those who feel their sins bearing down on them. virulent manual for the self-destruction of the human race: history, salvation, truth. or is fiction today's word on sesame street?"
sarc,is that the best you can do simone? i think the games up for you old girl! i used to do volunteer work for the samaritans in england and we had a few callers like you. it sometimes takes a while to suss out a fantasist but you do eventually!
sarc,"Did you slip in it AGAIN? Were you led astray by a passage from Heller you thought you could use to legitimize gun control, your wet dream?I submit from many past rulings of the courts that little statement is in error."
sarc,"i don't see why not. if somebody is perfectly willing to murder you in cold blood despite your blind compliance i see no reason to believe that they'd hesitate if it meant crushing a skull with a bat rather than just shooting them in the face. seriously, what kind of stability are you dealing with when all it takes to motivate someone to murder is a simple question? a baseball bat isn't concealable like a handgun, is it? nor can it be readily used by someone suffering arthritis or used in a cramped location. any weapon can be used to inflict death and murder. the human body is hardly a modern marvel of resiliency and near-indestructibility. even sneezing wrong can be potentially fatal. certainly not. do you see a contradiction?"
sarc,"Obviously, in the event of a disaster, George W. Bush sure thinks he has a right to choose.Hmmm, let's see, should I interrupt my vacation just because people are drowning in New Orleans? Naw, I don't think I should. They're just poor people and they probably didn't vote for me."
sarc,"<flush>Just come up with something that discredits the resurrection, if you think you can. Should be easy for you Einsteins, shouldn't it?But in two years I haven't seen it yet. Not from you or anybody else.Where's the beef?"
sarc,That's an out that's peculiar to Christians. Good? Godidit. Bad? Devil's work.
sarc,that's pretty damn funny comming from you. if i am wrong why do you have countless threads that have been abandoned after you encountered people who refuted you? i don't play shotgun with frauds. look up gulliable in the dictionary. http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/ch/ch710_1.html try again. basilio uchuya and his wife admit to drawing them to sell to tourists based on comic books. you fell for a tourists scheme! how amusing.
sarc,"Now I read this and thought there are two ways I could describe you:1) You are very poorly read in history.or2) Why don't you give a damn about the born? at what point does that defenseless little child become second in your concerns to the unborn?I'm intrigued, I really am."
sarc,"d'ya think i should? make a mel gibson film and suddenly everyone's an expert eh? well despite what his gibson-ness would have us believe, gallipoli was a case of bad luck, incompetence and generals f*cking everyone over regardless of nationality. remember we lost huge numbers of british troops too. now i don't downplay the role of the anzacs, or their losses. but this was at a time when the british considered australians to be one and the same as themselves. there was hardly the conscious effort to use the anzacs as fodder over the tommies. gallipoli was a blunder (though again not as big a blunder as populist history has us believe) for everyone, regardless of nationality. there was certainly no sinister us and them between our nations- we were essentially considered as one."
sarc,bwhahaaa....this is unreal. precrime? seriously? minority report? and guns magically turn people into 'bad guys'? hum...good to know. and its funny: we will remove the temptation of a lethal weapon by enforcing new laws via our own lethal weapons.  you people are freaking retarded.
sarc,"as steve martin once said, 'well, ecuuuuuuse meeeee'. no polar icecaps today? ok what is the proper - pc terminology - that refers to the big chunk of ice, what sits over the top of the north and south regions of the planet? as long as it is not too long of a description or too lame - i can evolve to the next phase and say ...(thus and such)... instead. :) btw. iam sure that algore can remember the meaning of - 'polar icecaps'. sorry that, you can not."
sarc,"i lived next door to a dope dealer who was a murderer, am i dead ? no !"
sarc,He killed thousands of failed athletes? I must have missed this in the news.
sarc,"got anything more than your opinion that proves scientifically that the athletes will be completely safe and breathing pristine air with the factories shut down 2 weeks before the games start, and only half the cars taken off the road each day? i mean, it took a decade or more before the la basin declared victory over the dangerous pollutants that prevented asthmatics from going outside on certain days after we attacked the same problem back in the 70s. so don't you think it's a tad naive to think everything will be honky dory after 2 short weeks with these limited actions? and don't forget the neighbors the link mentions and their unending pollutants that will continue to come in on those same winds."
sarc,"confirming god is, at best, a one-on-one job....anyway. unless someone has personally experienced the things of god - how would one go about proving it? i know, i know...can't prove a negative...."
sarc,"that's one of the dumbest things i have ever heard. if these dummies don't have a problem with information increasing, but do have a problem with beneficial information increasing, don't you think there is a problem? you included. you don't have a problem with change, only good change bugs you. dumb!"
sarc,"yeah, archie, i don't know what i was thinking. how could i form an opinion on the deeds of you and easy after about 6 years of interacting with the two of you, and watching the abuse and vile you spew on everyone who doesn't agree with your hate filled rhetoric? sorry about that, i must have been thinking of two other ignorant, insulting xxxxxxxs."
sarc,"Steeeeve?Do yourself a favor and stop fantasizing about my opinion, 'mmkay?I don't believe you are like that.This junk you do where you refuse to address what I DO say and make up strawman arguments gets you nowhere...I understand you're getting angry, but YOU are MAKING YOURSELF angry over a position I do not have...Let me repeat that. Hopefully it will sink in?YOU are MAKING YOURSELF angry over a position I do not have...With that said, I return you to your delusions..."
sarc,"emoticonXFrazzledTalk about a fast and loose accusation.WHAT DID HE ACTUALLY SAY???Cause Harry Hay is well known for his gay rights work.If Jennings did find something about the guy inspiring, it was probably his gay rights work.If I said that I thought Martin Luther King Jr was inspiring, would you automatically associate my praise with extramarital affairs?This is just stupid!"
sarc,"human is defined by whether or not you have a funeral, included in the census, and pay something to the state? a homeless illegal alien is screwed."
sarc,"what about all of the school killings that have involved use of revolvers, shotguns, and ieds? what's your p***ing away excuse for instances like these? in reality school shootings are linked to them being target rich environments where nobody can mount any opposition to the deranged killer. it's like a wolf in the chicken coop."
sarc,"absolute nonsense. nope, not at all. go read the relevant paper again. utter garbage. 'fittness'(sic), however you are defining that notion today, is a function of the relation of an organism with/to its own environment, but 'complexity', as any engineer or dictionary will tell you, is an intrinsic trait of whatever system has it; external environment be damned. so do you have a measure of complexity for a genome without reference to the external environment? really? what is that measure? you're entitled to your groundless opinion on anything, including parasites. yes i am, and i ought to be. i earned the right by doing original research on the topic of host-parasite relations as exlempified by chemical communications between them. did rather nice work at that. the core paper is still cited rather often even after 30 years."
sarc,"and a few posts later you whined about ad homs. maybe you could support that? perhaps you would prove to us that we are truly vile, evil, callous, despicable people that deserve to burn in the firey depths of hell for the murders that each and every one of us has committed? or perhaps you wouldn't."
sarc,"A sex offender is always wicked and villainous? Geesh, not very forgiving. While I certainly agree many are, I have seen many who are not a threat to society.Those folks on ""To Catch A Predator"" are definitely a threat though."
sarc,"Ah yes, your diversionary tactics. I am sure if I provided it, you would move the goal posts, or demand evidence that you know is not yet available.. So, since this thread is about Jesus, and if a 'historical' Jesus actually existed, where is your evidence besides religious articles, forgeries, and accounts taken from Christians?What?? No where to be found?? Gasp."
sarc,"lol. says the one who did not even bother to open the specific post link.  huh. again, you don't care about evidence. i gave it to you and you said i never did despite the link to the specific post right there.  liar you call me? well, i guess it takes one to know one.  questionable. all that the author did was state that the evidence rejects yec. he does not argue for another form of creationism.  please stop trying to argue there is only one form of creationism.  my god you are dishonest. still avoiding why arch would replace yec with christanity eh?  apparently you think interchangeability means that the words mean two different things despite being used interchangeably as the same."
sarc,"but the question is can you prove your belief system is true? and all you've done is spew hate for religion but haven't even tried to actually answer the question. and ask yourself this. if the idea of god is such a man made plague, then god doesn't even exist right ? so if god doesn't exist then what has he done to you to make you so venomous and angry at him ? why would you be so angry at a non existent being ? i challenge you to come up with a rational answer."
sarc,"since you are so oblivious to the truth, and probably flunked science a couple of times: http://www.mala.bc.ca/~johnstoi/essays/courtenay1.htm http://newton.nap.edu/html/creationism/evidence.html http://www.thekeyboard.org.uk/the%20...g%20theory.htm http://www.umich.edu/~gs265/bigbang.htm fact listen: [ fkt ] n.  knowledge or information based on real occurrences: an account based on fact; a blur of fact and fancy.  a. something demonstrated to exist or known to have existed: genetic engineering is now a fact. that chaucer was a real person is an undisputed fact. see above. http://www.carm.org/abortion/embryo.htm a piece of my hair is of the homo sapein species too. does that mean my hair is a person? perhaps you need to get your 'facts' straight."
sarc,"Reading Difficulties, huh?  There's a cure for that. It's called school. Perhaps you should go there....."
sarc,"i would ask you for a link, but this time i'm not feeling generous.  didn't you know that there are about 2.5 million cases of gun self defence annually, in about 92% of those cases nobody was harmed? does this even compare to the microscopic 102,200 deaths (don't tell me that's, wrong thats the very number that your cult has been using, comrade) that the brady fanatics have been whining about? your stats are simply untrue."
sarc,"Uhhhh, I just said that I DO JUDGE! So what in the hell are you talking about? You're not well. I didn't bother to adress your points about slavery because there's no point. I disagree with your claims as I suspect would most historians. But it doesn't surprise me that Christians would try to claim that they ended slavery since they also try to falsely claim they founded the country."
sarc,"only two choices? poor god, infinity reduced to black or white."
sarc,you really have no idea what a argument is? i do find it amusing you will lose every argument you get into with your significent other.
sarc,"that is an utter contradiction. he knows what is going to happen, but wants to preserve our freedom of choice? what freedom? please, explain so i can understand, this 'freedom' which gives rise to only one possible future! the existence of a god who can see the future implies we have no choice in shaping our destiny. no ifs, buts or maybes. this isn't about god deciding our future, it's about whether we can. well, that's one interpretation. another would be 'not sticking our heads in the sand'."
sarc,"Interesting.... have you ever been to a schoolyard recently? I think the ""taunts"" are more directed at gays. Like ""f@ggot"" and ""fairy"". What taunts do you get on a daily basis? What... being called out on your negativity towards the rights of a minority? boo hoo."
sarc,"and suddenly vor's list of incorrect statements has finished another lap around the universe! the area which was litterally saturated with cruise missiles was sparsely populated. the brass complained about 'hitting empty tents with multi-million dollar cruise missiles.'  suddenly you are concerned with killing innocent civilians? seriously, you have no problem when bush's policies gets a few thousand killed, but the instant clinton's massive cruise missile launch aganist terrorists kills one innocent, you're all over him. talk about massive hypocracy. you bitch about clinton not doing anything, then you bitch when his attacks on terrorism cause collateral.  seriously, get some therapy and some education."
sarc,"yeah, like the guy running from classroom to classroom killing at will. you think banning guns will prevent criminals from getting them? i was going to say that you live in your own little world, but then i realized the sad reality was that you are in this world stealing my oxygen.  what? either try that again, or find someone who can translate. i kinda thought that the insecure, paranoid people were the ones who were afraid to step up and take responsibility for their own safety and security. i don't need to carry a gun, i could just roll over and die like so many others when faced with an assailant intent on killing me. i choose however to take responsibility for my safety and security, and as such, want to carry a gun. there is a difference."
sarc,Yep.We must obey the will of the people.The vote was totally fair!So...why are those who obviously voted for M.A. rioting?I guess they are like America.Vote for someone insane...and then riot about the results.
sarc,I still haven't seen an adequate rebuttal to this. Why can't people marry themselves if they are in love with themselves?  I must have missed your response.
sarc,"Of course I can't. Can you guarantee that the apparent mugging about to happen isn't some poor slob about to ask directions? Big guy, dark parking lot, bang bang. Better safe than sorry, eh?"
sarc,"And you're mentally disturbed. Didn't I say that there is no such thing as a ""ex-gay""??? Did I stutter?You can pretend that denial is a river over in Egypt. Somebody thinking that they can successfully ""supress"" their true orientation, and deny themselves homosexual contact, is delusional..because the truth will always come out..because that's what the truth does. Show me an ex-gay, and I'll show you a liar. Where are they, that I can query them? I'll wait."
sarc,"Some slightly earlier history shows that Clinton wasn't quite that worried about Bin Laden. In 1996, the CIA had Bin Laden pinpointed on a ranch in Afghanistan. It needed permission ONLY from the Clinton White House (not Congress) to vaporize it - it was in the middle of nowhere. An official from the ""United Arab Emirates"" was with him, that was Clinton's excuse for not doing it. What did he think they were doing, making cookies, or did it dawn on him that they may have been up to no good?Thanks a lot, William Jefferson Clinton!"
sarc,Sure keep thinking that way and never mind the millions he put in his pocket. How was someone else put it? A thimble size brain case almost empty.
sarc,"i know i'm presenting facts to archie, sorry... archie, in point of fact you have it backwards. the theory of evolution was first, then abioegenesis. we know life exists. darwin, and others, explained how life changed from what it used to be to what it is now; they had no concern for where it came from in the first place, they simply knew that it came from somewhere. how did they know it came from somewhere? because there's life here now! the answer to the question of where it all started didn't get seriously studied until well after darwin. so no, the one does not pick up from the other, and the study of evolution does not in any way depend on abiogenesis. evolution doesn't care where life came from, only what happens to it once it's around."
sarc,"studies from 1955, 1961, 1964? i believe that a lot has happened since those years."
sarc,howard -  who do you say jesus christ is? the long awaited jewish messiah? your resurrected savior for the remission of your sins? the great god and savior (2 peter 1:1)? simple yes's or no's will suffice. p.s. you can probably buy that book i recommended on your argument at amazon.com.
sarc,wrong again!! .. as was just politely pointed out to me a minuet ago it's about ' what does termination stop ' and my answer adresses this. it's a valid point .. focus on the life here first befor allowing more unwanted life to be come a part of the system.  have you adopted an unwanted child yet? if not i would submit you should focus you anti abortion energy on those kids first.
sarc,"so you want to try it as a demonstration? i thought not. claims are easy to make but you have produced no evidence but words and only fiction to present.  yep, it is almost there per 100,000. meanwhile, your nation is rising by leaps and bounds and innocent people are being convicted to protect criminals. even dan rather commented on u.k. crime being much worse than any place in america. there is a reason for that...."
sarc,"i have never heard a conservative who was pro gay let alone pro same sex marriage. do you know of any? there is an old term that seems to apply 'if the shoe fits'. please i would like to know who these conservatives are that want gay people to be able to legally marry. who are they? since as you say i speak in generalities then you should have no problem listing these pro gay or por gay marriage conservatives. just because someone believes that the government should not be in the marriage busisness, as a libertarian, doesn't mean they support gay marriage."
sarc,"i don't want or not want to call this 'frame of refference' *thing* anything i'm just trying to work out what you consider it is. tell me what it is. tell me what it's capabilities are. if it is abstract in nature what is it's actual worth as a concept. whatever that is... this *something*? you aren't your body as i've shown but because your body generates your mind it, that which affects the body can effect the mind which i can only imagine is part of this 'frame of refference' *thing*. or, in reality, 'i', 'you' and 'me' is an illusion and doesn't actually exist."
sarc,"look around, the greatest majority of gun-related violence occurs were people aren't allowed to be armed, or have to go through great leaps and bounds to qualify for being armed. this is because the criminals who get their guns illegally and plans to use them to harm others know that their chances of encountering an armed victim are next to nothing, putting them in an near-absolute position of authority where they can do whatever they want. and the point is what exactly in this statement? last i checked thailand and israel were arming school teachers because too many students were either being held hostage or murdered. after the teachers became armed these rates dropped. why? because schools were no longer soft targets and threats could be met with deadly force immediately within a second's notice."
sarc,"So you disagree with Zardoz then? True christians are those who profess faith and bear false witness? True christians are those who are ignorant, vain, boastful insulting liars?Interesting..."
sarc,"<Flush>Your own source said there's a cliff a mile and a half away, and I'm the liar? Go find it and jump off it, you flaming, incompetent, scatter-brained, dishonest cretin."
sarc,"Whose culture are we talking about, here?I thought I was a member of the culture. What am I, chopped liver?"
sarc,"spoken like someone truly out of touch with reality. how long has it been since you were in high school? because if it hadn't been so long you'd know that short of coming to school in a banana suit (maybe not even then), kids could give two sh*ts about what other kids are wearing."
sarc,"to review. we have this piece of wonderful news stating that we cannot keep illegal products out of the country, and we should just give up and quit.    major panel: drug war failed; legalize marijuana  new jobs program by sinjin for the mexican drug cartels. inport illegal guns in too.    and this news from a country much like ours.   australia. with much much more gun control than you want at this particular moment, and they still have the illegal gun problem.  and yet you still insist on laying this off on our constitution? the probability of success is zero, and you know it! so what is your real reason for burdening the constitution? ooooo! ooooo! i know! you dont like it!  isnt that what you told charlie?"
sarc,lol just can't keep a good thing down can you gans? i love how it is only you and archie who have flocked to the thread in utter dismay... i'm sure easy will be right behind carrying a crucifix to ward off the 'gay'..... and no i do not think it will be overturned and i am ecstatic that marriage equality has extended to our nations capitol. let freedom ring baby!!!!
notsarc,"'would the french accept people singing the la marseillaise in english as a sign of french patriotism? of course not,' there are so many flaws in this comparison it is unbelievable. firstly, there are virtually no french citizens for whom english is their first language. second, english isn't the national language of the us, nor is it a language that evolved there. a better comparison would be la marseillaise translated into bretagne, or translating 'oh canada' into french."
notsarc,about as much 'soverienty' legitimation as hitler had when he was butchering the jews. no cause? you forget about trying to murder bush #41. no cause? you forget about him funding palestinian terrorists at $25k a pop. no cause? you forget about invading kuwait. no cause? he kicked out the u.n. inspectors. no cause? he fired at our airplanes who patrolled the no-fly zones. no cause? the mass graves and stalinist government? and these are just the things we know for certain.
notsarc,"what is this fsm? if it follows what god says, then it would be a suitable compromize, but i've never heard of this fsm."
notsarc,"And if there are two competing hypotheses that are actually hard to choose between? As they get closer, it becomes less possible to choose by instinct or testing. A principle comes in handy."
notsarc,"Because they couldn't own models like the AR-15 or AK-47? Last I checked those were banned in Chicago and much of Illinois, limiting people to mainly deer rifles."
notsarc,"okay, my computer is too slow to go search some statistics and copy the url to try and defend my opinion; but, here is my opinion anyway. one reason there are so many crimes against women, or crimes in general, is that offenders are repeat offenders much of the time. how many times have you heard of a child molester being released from prison and repeating the crime? there is not much determent to crime when criminals are put in jail for a year and on their first parole hearing are released back on the street to repeat offenses. i don't know what the answer is --but i think that is the reason there are so many crimes, especially sex crimes."
notsarc,"'Most Biblical scholars'? If you mean they think the letters are forgeries and weren't at least dictated by Paul, then it's just not true that most Biblical scholars think that. I agree in terms of the idea that Paul in some cases had someone else actually put the words on paper and he told them what to write, but that's pretty irrelevant here, IMO."
notsarc,"Umm.. again they are identified as Messianic Jewish. Google 'Messianic Jewish' if you care, thousands of hits. So you now try to personally misidentify this 'Jewish' group on your own terms? A Messianic Jew is a Jewish person who believes that Yeshua (Jesus) is their Messiah. Some people (You) think that a Jewish person who believes in Jesus is no longer a Jew. But what could possibly be more Jewish than believing in the Jewish Messiah, Yeshua? But anyway, that is NOT the point, the point is the same as I made before: The fact that there are Messianic Jews shows exactly what I was outlining in the top post. You seem to be inferring that I am suggesting that such 'change' means a change for ALL Jews, sic, obviously I am not suggesting that."
notsarc,"Use some basic comprehension indeed. How do you think Dohzhansky 'produced' assortative mating? It was by letting the laboratory population go on interbreeding for enough generations - exactly as happens when assortative mating occurs within or between natural populations. What, did you imagine he operated on them, or something? Geeeeez.."
notsarc,"we could make this a little contest i suppose and see who gets the most right. for the primary categories anyway. picture, acting, directing, writing, any others? also definitely say what you think will, and what you think should."
notsarc,"That's certainly an interesting point. I know next to nothing about global economics, so I won't try to argue here. But I will make a guess that such a thing will never happen as long as we're still a superpower and cling to our beloved dollar. Probably we'll devolve into just four or five major currencies in the next 50 or so years and leave it at that for a long while.But to stay on topic, I'm just wondering why such a thing was brought up as a Sign of The End. Why would it seem evil to someone living back then? It's an oft-quoted religious statistic that always leaves me scratching my head."
notsarc,"i believe that evolution is a perfectly logical idea. (from the science point of view)all humans are traced to monkeys from africa. from there they spread throughout the world. if it is not evolution, then why do humans from high elevations have larger lungs? how come africans have a darker skin tone? how come humans from cold regions have a thicker coat of hair? i doubt it is coinsidental, and no offense, but i dont think that a god did this for us. every person has a subconscience. in this subconscience we think of lesser facts. does that mean that it is possible for the subconscience to create the genetic material used for reproduction a way to survive better? i believe so."
notsarc,"well, signorile certainly didn't back up his opinions in this instance. how do you know it's the truth? if it were definitive, i'd be more inclined to agree. it's not 'common knowledge' that merv griffin was gay, at least not outside of hollywood. i'd never heard it myself. i don't see how you could know for certain anyone was gay that was in the closet unless they admitted to it or were seen doing something that made it clear they were (like having sex with someone of the same gender).  and the idea he should be hold some responsibility for not talking to reagan about aids in the 80s is absolutely opinion."
notsarc,"'two other sacramento-area police officers also were implicated in illegal weapons sales but not charged because they didn't turn large profits,' ah it's ok to sell illegal weapons as long as you don't make a big profit?  'california law bars citizens from buying handguns that have not been deemed safe by the state department of justice, but the law exempts peace officers.' the cops there are above the law? had to put a new hard drive and install,good to be back."
notsarc,"What exactly has bin Laden gained? The last I heard, some 75-80% of his top leadership is dead or in the slammer. With ""friends"" like Bush, who needs enemies? How would you like to be on the run or living in a hole for the rest of your natural days? That's the life that bin Laden lives today. He has to communicate to the outside world via courier and donkey. And tell me again, how bin Laden gains by killing Muslims? I don't quite get that part."
notsarc,What good has come from religion? None that I can see.
notsarc,"So the initial murder wasn't enough to show ""that they are willing to commit acts of violence""? This makes absolutely no sense."
notsarc,"ya know what? this has inspired me to make a thread, hold on a sec."
notsarc,"based on what? you admit there were 800,000 abortions performed in 1973 but yet if you dared to check the fertility rate between 1972 to 1973 it is nearly static; meaning there were just as many people giving birth before and after roe. surely, 800,000 potential births being aborted would have cut the fertility rate sharpely but it didn't.  you don't have to be a rocket-scientist to speculate what this means; that just as many women were having abortions between 1972 - 1973 and roe v wade only changed who was performing these abortions...not whether people were having them or not."
notsarc,How does this have anything to do with marriage? Reproduction occurs outside of marriage and has done so long before man became civilized.   Permitting only gay marriages won't decrease numbers. Increased family planning and birth control will.
notsarc,"simple answer? dc has a lot less budget than the usa government. more complex answer? just looking at the commuters, there are over 400,000 people that come to work in dc every day (see link in my last post). making the preposterous assumption that they all come in at a constant flow, just looking at 400,000 of them and assuming that you would only check them coming in, that's ~4.6 people admitted per second for every second of the working week. good luck with that. good luck with convincing people that it's constitutional, as well - airports get away with it, but only because there is such a (largely unfounded) fear of death by terrorist that they can get away with something which is constitutionally shady. a quick search gave me two relevant results almost immediately."
notsarc,"this is getting mighty old trebor.  i'll take that last post as a tacit admission that you had, indeed, invented budge as a source. the question then becomes, where did you get these ideas from first time around, and why aren't you sharing them with us? why did you feel compelled to fib? this photo brings up a bunch of other questions. on what website did you just find that picture? how and why are you interpreting it as it you are?"
notsarc,"so God would rather have evil in the world than infringe freedom. how very libertarian of you, jyoshu.but actually, are evil and freedom inversely proportionate? look at the examples i gave: slavery is both evil and an infringement on human freedom. on top of that, God puts evil into people and then does not take responsibility when these people do evil things... not to mention the evil that he himself has done. murder, genocide, bigotry... the lot.if he made people with complete freedom, he MUST have made people with evil as well. why did he do that? the only reason i can come up with is that if God made everyone in his image, he himself must be evil, even partially. that that is apparent in the bible."
notsarc,"and how do you know?? let's see evidence of this. or, it is just one of your proclamations?? that statement says to me 'i can close my eyes to all evidence, all common sense, because i believe in god'."
notsarc,how? which does not change the fact that government theft is not.
notsarc,"prosecutors of every party under pressure to keep their conviction rate up? it's not an unreasonable argument to say it's better to make sure the criminal is put away than gamble on the risks in a trial of intimidated witnesses, forensic screw-ups etc. it's also not unreasonable to suggest that the harm done by making child abuse or rape victims give evidence in court outweigh that done by a small reduction in setence for the perpetrator."
notsarc,"I don't believe that Orthodox doctrine deals directly with WWII. I am unfamiliar with such. Are you saying that the event you stated had a direct bearing on the cause of the war?Our doctrine would deal with evil, in general. But there may be Orthodox writers who have commented on the war. We are a Church with doctrine, but it would take more than a number of writers commenting on something to make it a 'doctrine'.Armenia was the first nation on earth to adopt Christianity."
notsarc,"why do so many lifers just skip right past the pregnancy as if it has no impact? i am not talking about parenting. i don't advocate forcing anyone to parent. ever. that is why i support safe haven laws, signing away of parental rights, etc. i am talking about pregnancy. only a woman can be pregnant and should have the ultimate say in whether or not she is. it is her body, not your's, not the state's, not the church's, and not the fetus'.  when it comes to pregnancy - you wish only to legislate the bodies/reproductive organs of women. i bet you would not advocate chemical castration for any male who is not yet ready to be a parent."
notsarc,"but why should i care about their emotions? they obviously don't care about mine. this is in reference to the jonestown massacre, where this cult leader convinced his followers to drink a soft drink (i don't think it was actually kool-aid) laced with cyanide. okay."
notsarc,"The egyptians predicted his birth, death, WWI, WWII, and they have predict the supposed end of the world. Are you saying that this religion was wrong? They predicted a lot more that I have not put that have come true."
notsarc,"that seems to beg the question. be convinced one way or the other as much as you like, but if you can't prove your position, or even provide evidence for it, then how can you possibly use it to justify anything? yes, people's religious beliefs influence them. what shooter seems to be asking is if that's in any way reasonable? if you're basing your entire life on some point, should you be able to show that your beliefs about that point are true? put another way, it's kinda dumb to base major life decisions on a feeling, isn't it?"
notsarc,The point is that there are plenty of issues that go on in church meetings and denominational conventions that are areas of enormous disagreeement and struggle. It happens--it's not just this issue. You just don't hear about them because the press isn't interested in those issues.
notsarc,"wow, you're only 17? i definately had you in mid 30's maybe early 40's."
notsarc,"so do you think before you speak? abraham left mesopotamia, modern day iraq, for canaan to start a new religion. so where did he start the religion? canaan, modern day israel.  and yes i know that there is much more to the bible and my point was that you can't believe the bible 100 percent world for world or you would be contradicting yourself."
notsarc,"'diversionary tactic'? the topic was 4 july and independence day. out of curiosity, did gw sign the declaration of independence? was he the first president? he didn't lead a bunch of rebels and militia? i never said you were a socialist, that you were educated in socialist schools. the result is evident. you don't have the fortitude to go to nara and read the truth in our history archives yet you snipe around trying to change the subject which is independence day. if it happened once before in can be repeated not only here but in other countries as well...and it is!"
notsarc,"well, since we are talking about a gay man, i would guess it would most likely be masculine. yeah, you are being kinda homophobic. why would you possibly care if a gay man sees you in the shower? they're not going to do anything to you. if you treat someone differently for no reason other then the fact that they're gay, that's homophobia. gays are just like everyone else, excpect they're sexually attracted to the same gender. their interests cover the same spectrum as yours, sex aside. they are just as likely to be masculine or feminine as a straight man. gays are, in everyway outside of sexual preference, just like straights. so while you can certainly be selective about who your friends are, if you write someone off just for being gay that would be a shame, and a sign of prejudice."
notsarc,"is this what jpsartre meant? at any rate, to say that there were large numbers of gay men, being infected in the u.s., is not saying there is a connection between aids or its spread and homosexuality in itself. there is a connection when there is active sexuality, gay or straight, and aids is a sexually transmitted disease. we actually don't know who patient zero was. what is the point of saying initially it affected much larger numbers of gay men, and fewer heterosexuals, to the best of our available knowledge? this is a disease, and unknowingly spreading it, no matter who you are, is not murder. the fact that much more transmission was initially occuring in a certain group, who had sex among that group, before that group knew it existed and what it was and how to prevent it; that would also not be murder."
notsarc,"good question.  let us say that dawkins is my teacher.  in the ben stien interview , dawkins said that evolution is fact, as much of a fact, as we can know anything to be a fact... ok?!?! dawkins also says that we do not know how life originates from inornanic, nonliving compounds and he says, that, he doesn't know and no one else does either. ok!!?! well i do not accept that as an explanation - so - i guess i am not blindly following this irrational line of logic. i would have to say that - i am not being 'indoctinated'. at the same time, dawkins has nothing to teach me so i guess i am not being 'educated' either. hmmm. i guess i would have to say that in this case i am - neither."
notsarc,"'if it's beside the point' the why bring it up, jyoshu. why 'talk out of both sides of your mouth'?  and your right wing talking points are stale and tired. comparing different civil rights movements is not 'piggybacking'. and incidentally, why is it that all of the blacks in congress for equal rights for glbt people? why is it that they are the most passionate defenders of glbt people? there are black gay people who suffered along with the straight black people. there are female gay people that suffered along with the women. on top of such discrimination, gay people may have had no family support. some were probably lobotomized against their wishes. some were raped, some were probably murdered by people they thought would understand what discrimination was all about. no, my friend. it is disingenuous to say with certainty that you know they have not."
notsarc,"How else should it be done? It is a constiturionally protected right. To eliminate that right, the constitutional protection must be removed first, is the removal itself, becomes unconstitutional."
notsarc,"[quote=jo bennett;314232]stabbing yourself is not ok, but that doesn't mean it should be illegal. i'm not even going to bother with your non-sequitor, but i imagine plenty of alcohol manufacturers enjoy the occasional drink. these are mostly caused by illegal guns. you can't outlaw something thats already illegal. i highly doubt this. how can a gun be illegal when it used to be legal? most illegal guns are bought off the black market."
notsarc,"hmmm, the employment, housing, and accommodation thing is really state based and for employment i am pretty sure every state doesn't allow you to ask about sexual orientation.  as for marriage...anyone is allowed to marry (so long as they are of age). you just have a problem with the definition of marriage. as for the military thing...seems like a complicated issue. where does a gay man shower for example? the womans bathroom? there own special bathroom? the mens bathroom? other issues involving relationships could arise as well. as for the adoption thing...only florida doesn't allow it outright."
notsarc,"how did you overcome all the similiarities? nothing was ripped and i stated your question and my response. originally i could have made it clearer, but you could have also used the scroll bar. responses to specifics within a post dont carry forward. you would have to be willing to accept that proof. if your not then it isn't possible to prove it to your satisfaction is it. read the source i posted earlier. maybe we should let the church go back to allowing only priests to have bibles and if that doesn't work kill some skeptics.  i don't suppose jews, hindus, muslims and bhuddists qualify as non-believers or were you being area specific?"
notsarc,"I think that's a good question. I also wonder how long the medical establishment has had this rule? Since there must be some long-standing procedures in executions in the United States that require, by law, a doctor's supervision."
notsarc,"ephesians does indeed talk of salvation through faith created in christ jesus unto good works(2:10). i must admit that im not totally sure what this means, that faith leads to good works? id dispute that. whilst most of romans does talk of salvation through faith, romans 2:6 says however god will render to every man according to his deeds. in the end, the point is moot. i dont really care if the bible does say that man is justified by faith alone (and it doesnt conclusively), my point is that i am unwilling to worship a creature that justifies only by faith anyway."
notsarc,"what knowledge do you have concerning haliburton?  they are a conglomeration construction companies who, because of their qualifications, get overseas contracts. knowledge of codes and history of quality being factors. you seem to oppose their success. why?"
notsarc,"truth can be found in god. we as humans have a relative idea of what truth is because everyone will not agree on what is truth and what is not. for instance, one might say that europe will regain world power or that america will remain the world power but if everyone doesn't believe it how true is it? but universal truth can be considered aboslute such as math. 1 + 1 is 2, 12 inches equal a foot, etc. the question will remain to be unanswered until god reveals what truth is."
notsarc,"mike, you seem to imply that the story in genesis is false (whether intentionally or not), yet you accept the rest of the bible as true in its entirety? what about the flood, the plagues, the exodus on a whole? what about the other miraculous and unscientifically supernatural phenomenon that the bible describes? do you believe that these events took place at all? the bible does not only oppose science's theories of universal origin, it also opposes a huge amount of natural laws of physics. would you say that the bible is true and the events in it really occured?"
notsarc,assumption of 'millions'. they must of because how else can we account for the species today ? got any support for this ? i can prove the antidiluvians knew about and used pi. if man began as an ape/animal then how do you explain the fact that pi was not discovered until thousands of years later ? ray m.
notsarc,your argument is contradicting how can seeing people naked ifnringe on your personal thought and the other not? also the right isn't to marry whomever neterosexuals want. the limits apply to everyoen equally just people have different preferences.
notsarc,I don't that it's selfish so much as self-interested. There is a difference. Most people want to live a long life. Is this selfish? The idea of an after life is merely an extension of this same idea.Why do you think belief in an afterlife leads to contempt for society?
notsarc,like most things in christianity as the catholic church got organized. http://kevinantoine.com/holytrinity.htm now why does that matter? the burden of proof is yours to prove that god exists and the bible is his communication to man. you have made absolutely no progress towards that end. do not think my speculation on the evolution of the internal inconsistencies of christianity in any way substitutes for that responsibility.
notsarc,"let me guess - you also believe that moses wrote the torah, wherein he describes his own death and burial? 'wild theory'? i suggest you do an internet search on the synoptic problem and the related two-source theory.  why do you demand that which you know cannot be produced? no, we don't have the q source, but we have evidence which points to a q source. likewise, we have a great deal of evidence which suggests that the torah had multiple authors."
notsarc,"do you believe the average individual actually has any personal control over providing basic essentials and security? most individuals exist from proceeds of a 'job' or government programs and would be lost without one or the other, of which they generally have no actual influence.  i find it difficult to accept that the average, individual us citizen has the brain power to be concerned about anything but what's on tv. voter apathy of 25% or less participation in municipal elections are a strong indication of individual need to be manipulated as governing powers see fit."
notsarc,"are uk mortgages packaged and peddled as securities as in the us? if so, is that (those) a government or quasi-government agency(s)? i ask to see where the eventual fallout will take place. the uk is much like the us in that when consumers default there's always a substantial amount of private money waiting for those adjustments to buy at the bottom for future resale. if they are in fact packaged, the security holders will have to write down their investments and defaults by the end of their fiscal year, normally determining the length of that cycle. we follow many of your economic cycles but i've never watched your residential real estate market. brown would have a tough time pulling that one out of the fire."
notsarc,"we are not talking about genesis as a story are we? we are talking about bilbical creation. you really are thick arent you? i know there are religious people, deeply and otherwise who accept the story of genesis as a story but that has no relevance to the thread. undisputable is only stupid because you cant provide it. certainly not as comprehensively as the aristotlian view of the universe was disproved. the horse evolution thread was fine...you have showed a little horse turning into a big horse and not one species actually evolving into another distinct species but i'll give you the benefit of the doubt. now show exactly how life originated and you're home and dry."
notsarc,"is two 'wrongs' more 'wrong' than one 'wrong'?  or perhaps, is two 'bads' more 'bad' than one 'bad'? i would say so.  but perhaps that`s just my utilitarian leanings talking."

notsarc,"How the heck does darwinism get one out of poverty????I think you are generalizing by lumping ALL education into the specific areas that some religious conservatives oppose. If they opposed getting degrees, going to grad school, etc., I could see your point. But I don't know of any religious sect that opposes that."
notsarc,"What has this got to do with the non-material world, of which God and you and I are a part of? I know that the Apostles witnessed God's miracles. I too am witness to God's miracles. The evidence is adequate for me and for much of the world's population.."
notsarc,"Do you? Care about gay people, that is. You keep imply that it's only their tactics you don't like, but I can't recall you ever saying that you support a persons right to be gay. So please, cards on the table. Do you support a person's right to have sex with whatever willing adult they choose? No politics, no tactics. Please, just answer that simple question."
notsarc,"you must be joking. i'm sure that making a gun is quite a bit more complicated than making a paper airplane. then why do nations which ban guns have a much lower gun crime rate than the us? if what you say is true then we would expect to see the same amount of gun crime in nations which ban guns as in the us, but we don't."
notsarc,propaganda?!! dou you make me sick! how can you see these and still make a jeer at these photos. have you know heart for sacrifise of human life? have you no cause? have you no heart!? my heart wrenched when i saw those and it angers me to see one who has been deluded by his own proclamed righteousness to still be better than human decency.
notsarc,"why do you refuse to address the atf emails showing that they were building support for new authority to regulate and dictate firearms sales? they are truly right there, out in the open and viewable by literally everyone. why do you ignore them?"
notsarc,"Why do you think they feel no emotion? All the women I know who have aborted did so under very difficult circumstances and it was horrible for them.Most women who seek abortion are not unfeeling sluts. They are real women, with real issues, and real circumstances that lead them to that choice. Want to help those babies? Address the issues the women face and don't demonize. No amount of legislation can make for succesful pregnancy without the support of the mother. Dismiss her and you will fail to do anything to help anyone."
notsarc,"...well...in the last decade or so we've been starving them to death. where have you been? the arguments are very similar if you consider a fetus to be a human being. i'll grant you that. in the case of your c-section question, i think the mother should have the section, but we can never compell her to do so. it would be too dangerous a precedent to contemplate."
notsarc,"if a frog had wings he wouldn't bump his butt when he jumped. based on results paul had more influence. how can you simply ignore the obvious? christianity has hurt itself over and over again because of it's unwillingness to concede that sometimes it's wrong. how long did it take the church to acknowledge the earth moves around the sun or that the earth wasn't flat.  instead they either ignore the issue, bury it through violence or intimidation, or come up with some ridiculous idea that is based on nothing to justify why they are right."
notsarc,"However, so much of the sex, in fact, most of the sex that happens, gay or straight, does not lead to reproduction. Why is there not the same aversion to oral sex, masturbation, condoms, dating, etc.? No one is saying people who do those things should have fewer rights, be excluded, or should not be equal, provided those people are not gay."
notsarc,"what makes you think they're not true? jesus arose from the dead. that's one of the most well attested to facts in ancient history, whether you want to casually sweep it under the rug or not.  many skeptics set out to prove the story of christ to be a fairy tale. none succeeded and a number became believers. you guys are playing with absolute fire. if you're wrong (and you are), you're screwed big time. big time and forever. do you feel lucky? well, do you?"
notsarc,"well, i'm back from my rejuvenating outing. did i have any epiphanies, you ask?  what, one wonders, could the old masters have produced if their minds were unrestricted, their canvases allowed to contain any subject capable of being conceived, without the censorious church acting as final arbiter and judge? mankind could have had this centuries earlier to uplift us in troubling times, and ennoble us in our daily pursuits."
notsarc,I saw that...was that all they had to say on the issue? I was looking for how they died...was in the doctor that did it or what? Aside from that...what is your point? I don't understand how this related to Planned Parenthood misleading people.
notsarc,"good questions. its not a condition, i don't agree.  jesus doesn't open the lock to the pearly-gates for some people, he is the gate. do you see what i mean? that's what he said, 'i am the way... no one comes to the father except through me'. i think its like saying you shouldn't put conditions on the way into a house, you should be able to walk in from any spot - and saying that having to go through the door is a condition. why would people not choose heaven? its a hard road."
notsarc,"Your partner wouldn't happen to be a guy, would he? As for your Christian friend, ask her to join the fray. I'd like to ask her a few questions, such as:Who do you say Jesus Christ is? If not Lord, God, Savior, and Jewish Messiah then she is on the wrong page.Ask her if people need Jesus Christ for redemption for their sins?Ask her if people should repent of their sins and turn from them?Ask her who the Holy Spirit is? If not God, then she's on the wrong page (note Acts 5).Ask her if the Bible doesn't say gay sex is a sin (Leviticus 18:22, Lev. 20:13, Romans 1:26-27; I Corinthians 6:9-10; Jude 7, etc.)? Those will do for starters."
notsarc,does it really matter? the heller decision left the door wide open for most of the restrictions that brady campaign favors. why should this case be any different?
notsarc,"Now you are confusing me. In a previous post, you wrote this: ""A gay couple has no more right to marry then two brothers""But now you say that you never said there ""is no right to same sex marriage."" So are you arguing that two brothers do have the right to marry? I am reading your posts, but you seem to make contradictory arguments. That may be because I just don't understand what you are writing.I thought you were arguing that there is no right of same-sex couples to marry but that they should be allowed to marry anyway. It sounded like a nuanced argument to me. But apparently that is not what you were saying? Can you clarify this?Thanks."
notsarc,"If Congress decides to remove the law, what can the military do?Nothing.Logically, they're not a barrier..."

notsarc,"that was a similar argument used for every single scientific discovery since the beginning of time. were is the biblical proof that god doesn't want cloning? those that said the earth was round instead of flat were labled heretics. many people believed flying should be left to the birds that god created. in fact, some faith's still believe that science is wrong, medicine is a sin. it is a good thing that we don't let religion dictate our science, or we'd still be thumping eachother with clubs and eating raw meat. pride caused the fall of the son of morning, not scientific discovery."
notsarc,"i see some names that don't seem to fit. c.s. lewis was a writer and scholar, you want to include tolkien too? aristotle was a prolific thinker but hardly conservative. it is as if you are trying to graft liberal (proper use of the word) philosophy on to traditionalism. you have rand, do you mean rand paul or ayn rand? quotes about the size of government from conservatives and founder types... it is the size of government that matters, not necessarily how it is financed. - dan mitchell senior fellow in political economy, the heritage foundation my reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government. - jefferson government, even in its best state, is but a necessary evil; in its worst state, an intolerable one. - thomas paine  what do you have to say about the 'proper' size of government?"

notsarc,"i'm not playing word games. you said congress doesn't have the power to declare war; how else am i supposed to read that? you meant congress doesn't run the war...you clarified, end of story."
notsarc,"it's not a state's issue from a gay rights perspective, if the supreme court of the us rules that discrimination of same-sex couples is illegal in marriage, as it did for inter-racial couples. what would this proposed new contract that resembles marriage, be called? we already have such a contract. there's no need to totally re-invent the wheel at this particular time. foundit is correct. it's telling that this issue only comes up when people are looking for a way to not recognize gay couples in marriage."
notsarc,"You failed to answer a question. Have you had an abortion? I'm not arguing against abortion or for it, I'm arguing against your faulty premise that the abortion debate can't be related to slavery. Cite your source on that APA study. Because I found multiple sources that say while some women feel relieved, others have emotional problems. I would like to know whether these women had early or late-term abortions. Either way, I doubt the majority is relieved."
notsarc,"what extended family interference? even mass same-sex marriages can't get ss benefits. you should research joint tenants in common becasue that isn't true that isn't a gaornment decision. that is a business decision. businesses can decide to allow it if they want to, so marriage wouldn't change that. i'm saying what can't you do without it. not about marriages in mass. also the federal government wouldn't recognize it anyways because of defense of marriage act. so far you haven't named one yet. also as couples you don't have that right but individually you have the rights as any citizen.  calling me full of **** while i just showed you have you're wrong.. funny."
notsarc,"ridiculous. if ic cannot support id, id has absolutely nothing going for it, right? including their supporters of ic, since all of them with the exception of you use it to support id. behe is wrong, dembski is wrong, johnson is wrong, every id supporter is wrong for using ic, because freedom the great thinks it's wrong. daewoo: ic is irreducible complexity, the idea that complex biological systems like the eye or bacterial flagellum could not have evolved through a gradual process, but had to have been formed all at once, by a designer with a function in mind. id is intelligent design, creationism with new pseudo-scientific skin, a political ploy for creationism to gain scientific respect. it failed. michael behe is an advocate of id who came up with ic."

notsarc,when did mike moore do that? how about in bowling for columbine when he portrayed chuck heston. here is the scene: 1) cut to heston wearing a dark suit. 2) cut to crying children outside columbine high school. 3) cut to heston saying 'from my cold dead hands.' case in point. both portions of the speech were not in dever nor were they about columbine. i got another quote from mike moore.

Remember that no security measures are perfect. We will never be safe, only safer.And what is your point about weapons/guns? I don't get it."
notsarc,But it is OK to teach your religion in public school classrooms? Is that what you mean? What about my religion. Is it OK for me to teach it to your children against your will?
notsarc,Did he say it should only be lowered for gay relationships? Probably not. Are there straight people who would advocate for changing the age of consent? Yes. There are different arguments for and against lowering the age of consent which have nothing to do with gay equality rights.
notsarc,"This is the most asinine argument yet. The man was making six figures as a radio talk show host. Why would he leave that job to hit the road for 18 hour days away from family merely in the hopes of hawking a few extra books? He had an ESTABLISHED platform to sell boks viz a viz his radio show, his frequent substitutions on other programs, and his status as a darling of the Tea Party. The man could line up paid speaking engagements to hawk his book. Why would he trade that for unpaid speaking engagements to hawk his book?"

notsarc,"what does that have to do with the issue being discussed? unless you're suggesting that for gays to refer to themselves as ethmi did is an expression of self loathing. is that the point you're trying to make? beside, by presenting a film with dick gephart and gene robinson as examples of god fearing christians, you immediately expose yourself as someone who has no concept of what a true believer in christ is. so why should a film that is nothing more than secular humanist propaganda be taken seriously at all?"
notsarc,"Common sense? A collection of human cells as yet not developed enough to have even the potential for consciousness a human being? Uncommon sense IMO. Just the use of the term ""unborn"" is ridiculous. Are the rest of us the ""undead""?"
notsarc,"what is capitalism? can there be something like 'responsible capitalism' and, if so, what would 'responsible capitalism' be? my view is that the term 'capitalism' has a multitude of meanings dependent upon who is defining it and that 'capitalism' could have a multitude of modifiers to further refine its meaning. is to be a capitalist to be utterly free of responsibility and blame for the evils that capitalism may cause?"
notsarc,"Well that is good that you recognize our society eats too much meat and too much protein. Now will you agree with me that you can get all the protein you need from whole wheat bread, oatmeal, beans, corn, peas, mushrooms, and broccoli? Now granted some vegetarians eat alot of junk food, and in that case they are NOT getting the right amount of protein. But many vegans like myself dont eat ANY junk food and follow the recommended food pyramid for vegans. I follow it very strictly and I know beyond any doubt that I am more healthy than the vast majority of Americans out there."
notsarc,"that's a real laugh, coming from someone with so little knowledge of the legal and justice systems as you. do you even know what goes into obtaining a search warrant? do you know what the limitations are regarding the scope of a search warrant and how it has to be narrowly tailored to something specific and nothing else? right. and it was ca law that lead to a father's children being murdered because he thought he was obligated to keep his guns locked up at all time, making them inaccessible even in a true life or death emergency. it was also california law that proved just how registration can, does and will, lead to confiscation. they proved our case for us and showed everyone that we weren't paranoid, and instead knew exactly what we were talking about."
notsarc,"probably because the article is irrelevant. either way, i posted an article to make you happy so quit compaining and just answer the question with some respect. thanks for just simply answering dog....i'm not sure why it is so complicated. if you don't ask race than how can you be prejudice? there is also no proof that people would currently be discriminated against. but current affirmative action is a topic for another thread."
notsarc,why are these murders 'blatant racist killlings'? the article you posted makes it sound like a robbery gone bad.
notsarc,"i am quite the anti-hypocrisy advocate. as for my personal take, 17-year olds should not be taking pictures like that. do you disagree? prejean should not have lied about it. anything beyond that is pointing out hypocrisy. seeing some of hilton's work, i don't see why he should be in a position to judge anybody. i think the 'adds a little flavor to a dull contest that no one cares about' is exactly why he was chosen."
notsarc,"did prohibition of alcohol do any good? nope, just made the criminals all the more powerful. did prohibition of drugs do any good? nope, just made the criminal all the more powerful. will prohibition of legal firearms do any good? not a chance in hell. banning legal ownership has never, ever, ever done anything toward ending the illegal use of something. never has, never will. it's absolutely impossible and just shows far for withdrawn people are from the real world in their thinking."
notsarc,We are on due process now? How can you evolve how you deal with due process? Due process simply means that processes which are required by law. The court evolved this into substantive due process which is changing the meaning of the constitution. Do you deny substantive due process?
notsarc,"never heard of it. tell me, what is the most troubling thing you have read in this bill so far? one thing i did not like was that it required me to buy insurance or pay a fine."
notsarc,"Another cheap attempt at diversion on your part? Once again, EZ, I'm not taking your diversionary bait. Instead, I suggest that you give some serious consideration to the nature of your sources. Doing so will save you a lot of humiliation."
notsarc,"it's a pretty obvious counter question, i'm surprised it caught him so off guard. what's his name, if you don't mind my asking? i've got friends in illinois who would appreciate knowing about this, if they're in his district."
notsarc,"Well for one thing religion is specificly mentioned in the constitution, not as 100% protected but in that gov't cannot mandate a religion. Also, religion is not unilateraly protected, as I've stated several times. There are many restrictions put on religion by government and if government can restrict religion then why not which marriages they recognise? That being said I have long been a supporter of limited gov't and believe that gov't has no business endorsing or giving advantages to any marriage. They should be silent on the subject."
notsarc,"yes, it happened through mutation. what do you mean by 'what sort'? i assume you're looking for something more in depth than 'the genetic sort'. i'm afraid i can't rattle off the difference in the sequences if that's what you want. if that's not what you want than you'll have to ask a more specific question."
notsarc,"proving my beliefs from the bible is not being un-christian. is it? as i said i don't want to debate it with you, i just like to know who i'm typing to. simple."
notsarc,"i simply quoted to you your own scripture, ez. how is that construed as bashing? de 21:20-21 and they shall say unto the elders of his city, this our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard. and all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die:  mr 16:17-18 and these signs shall follow them that believe; in my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover."
notsarc,"So everyone thinks that ""evolutionists"" should seize power or something? If that is true, it is because evolution is very widely accepted."
notsarc,does the military have a position on this or have any data to show it helps or hurts something? really that is what it should come down to.
notsarc,"so wouldn't that cover almost all of africa? there are so many people dying in the city streets of hunger in our own country, yet we elect a president who wants to address a problem in iraq rather than our own country? if we truly tried to help all those less fortunate than ourselves, we would be helping africa a lot more than we are now (their average life expectancy is like 30). yes iraq was terrible, but guess what, other countries might think our country is terrible. that is not our concern and at least we could wait until we fixed all of our own problems first. we have poor hungry starving people on the streets of the us and we go to another country to solve their problems?"
notsarc,"this an example of what i am saying you choose to ignore the moral command from the ot to burn witches whereas in the middle ages that moral command was followed this passage also mentions that you must pay taxes as well, are you rebelling against god if you complain about the redistribution of wealth through taxation if it set by the governing authority ? i also believe that passage can cause all sorts of problems, for example a fascist regime is a governing authority should you submit to a government that is morally unjust ?  bad in general, and no i don't think the same. as i said i have started to modify my socialist principles, i have a great sympathy for the anarchist way of thinking. where the state is a way to oppress the masses."
notsarc,So have you found figures pertaining to the rate of mountain growth? It is not enough to see with the naked eye the way erosion is. This explanation would also cause some mountains to fall as tectonic plates move away from eachother. Again after billions of years all rivers in existence would be deeper than those in the grand canyon without the material coming down from mountains.
notsarc,"What is conveniently missing from your response? An explanation of why a limit on the number of guns that can be purchased during a certain time period is not a law which imposes ""conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms"" per Heller. If the punishment does not fit the crime it does not necessarily follow that the crime is Constitutionally protected. Executing someone for shoplifting would be unjustifiable. However, that does not mean that there is a Constitutional right to shoplift."
notsarc,i think you may be very very suprised by roberts. i like some of the answers he is giving. i have a feeling you conservates may get f***cked. he is not as conservate as you think. besides even if he is conservate he certainly is not as conservate as the emoticonxcensored he is replacing.  as a citizen of virginia do you support this law that strips people of their wills and powers of attorny? http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp...41+ful+hb751s1 this is just a very mean law and will hurt many people.
notsarc,"no, i completely agree. it's frustrating from a woman's point of view also. does this mean that if a father and mother take their child out somewhere, it's solely the woman's responsibility to take care of the child? things should definitely be levelled when it comes to parenting."
notsarc,"Yes, but how do you legally get it into international waters? Once there, where do you go? There aren't too many ports where ordinance is allowed. Since I am a law abiding citizen, where, other than international waters, may I legally have a gun?"
notsarc,"ah i see. so we take away the right of someone to do with their own body what they want to, unless they pay the government more money? sound a little too much like bribery to you too? and how would clamping down on hard drugs be a good thing? how about we concentrate on the real crimes in our society, and let people kill themselves/ruin their lives if they want to. why should i be spending tax dollars (ok, well hypothetically, pretend i pay taxes) to force someone else to not hurt themselves? sound a little counter-productive? and then we complain about a defecit? (obviously that's not the main culprit of spending, but you get the point)."
notsarc,"any evidence for said 'abandonment'? also, the thing most likely to secure a lasting peace in israel-palestine is for the us to stop subsidising the oppression of the palestinian people. in any case, i thought we were talking about abm systems, i'm not aware of israel having such a system."
notsarc,"see there is such a thing as heterosexual privledge. some heterosexuals will do anything, or say anything to protect this privledge. for the christianist it is all about control, and money. the christianist will say anything or do anything to maintian their money and control. take own own archangel, for example, in everyone of his posts he extols his religious beliefs and his belief that everyone should be both hetero and his brand of christian. one must ask themselves; why does he peach against something that does not personally effect his life? i have come to the conclusion that he is afraid that he will loose his heterosexual privledge and his control as a christian."
notsarc,"Reread my argument, please. I don't see incest as good or anything. What I do see is that the only real rational argument against it is the genetic trouble with offspring (all other arguments are actually problems that cause incest, not consequences of incest). And here, I see hipocrisy. We're prohibiting incest, but are not instituting a global consistent policy that would apply to any and all parents where genetic risks exist. Adult heterosexual consenting non-related parents whose procreation is almost guaranteed to cause genetic defects? We leave it to them to decide and choose the preventive measures. Related? Prohibit regardless of chance. And really, I would actually fully support such a (yes, very invasive) globally consistent policy. The double standard annoys me, not that I advocate incest (something people here fail to acknowledge)."
notsarc,the simple and most usual one would be bluntly that marriage is and always has been between members of the opposite sex. there may possibly have been some strange aberrations in the past but essentially that has always been the bottom line even for homosexuals. in addition to those there will be those who oppose it on religious grounds. and why shouldn't they if they so wish ? marriage is an institution not a right. if you don't qualify then you don't enter. by all means campaign to have the rules changed but don't be surprised if they aren't.
notsarc,So what are some examples of restrictive gun laws in South Africa? The people in South Africa think their gun laws are not strict enough.  In one of your previous posts you seem determined to use South Africa as evidence that outlawing guns doesn't work.
notsarc,Really? Show me that by quoting where the article says it.
notsarc,"is the legal aspect of it disputed or only whether it is immoral? i may be tooting my own horn, but this thread discussed the moral aspects of abortion in general, and this was my contribution. is that sort of what you're looking for?"
notsarc,"is this a case of the truth hurting? then i guess it would work both ways. how do you feel about 'christians' slagging off non-believers, declaring that they will end up in hell for denying god? conceited? yup. could i give a toss? nope. how do you think non-believers feel about the smugness of christians? and it's not just me who thinks they're fairytales and that christians are delusional, as you well know. so why personalise it? apart from that, a lot of us here have a thick skin. this is a debating forum, and there is little room for those with delicate sensibilities who feel insulted at the pov of others."
notsarc,"ok, great so far. we're getting some good predictions on both sides. i think this is going to be a lot of fun to look back at in time. keep it up. more topics... cap and trade. will strict controls be placed? what effects if so? iraq. will he pull out? what happens then? (with iraq or terror here or whatever) how much $$$ will he throw at the economic crisis? what will the outcome be? anything you all want to predict or comment on concerning the upcoming presidency will be appreciated. have fun!"
notsarc,"so? anyone can be a victim of sociopaths, no matter what their version of the golden rule. making one vulnerable or not, it's still a 'nicer' form of the ethic. what makes 'social cohesion' is peoples' desire for self-preservation, not compassion for others. that's not the golden rule, it's just the understanding that people are better off if they get along with others. it's sort of like the 'mutually-assured-destruction' doctrine of the cold war."
notsarc,"so who should make the choice in the scenario you propose? for me, it must always and forever be the woman. btw, why is it in your example that the man is not the one who refused to use birth control? in any case, i do not want the nanny state involved in the most intimate choice a woman will ever have to make. btw, who is simone?"
notsarc,"now lets add one more wrench into the anti-gun works! when the american people read, 90% of weapons come from the u.s. they are led to think, bought in an american gun store.  something even sinjin apparently believes as well. however, doing some research, i found this april 19, 2005 report that tells how u.s. weapons can end up in mexico and be things that the citizen cannot buy in a gun store. why? because they came from the u.s. government, dea and the cia. military grade weapons. now how many can be traced back to legally purchased u.s. weapons?    central america: the farc, the contras and the flow of weapons  america! get the picture now?"
notsarc,becasue tehre is no merit to the behavior that would need special recognition. should people with attachment disorders be allowed to be polygamists? what is so special about homosexuality that it deserves to be treated different than other behaviors? remember there is no definitve evidence that it is genetic.
notsarc,What kind of quality? How about speed?Free but slow and crappy healthcare is not acceptable and I'd vote a solid no.
notsarc,"How long has the boyfriend been 16? Is he closer to 15 or 17?How long has nocturnal09 been 14? Is she closer to 13 or 15?If nocturnal09 will be 15 in a couple of days or so and the boyfriend just turned 16 about a month ago, then the 14 vs 16 thing isn't really the biggest deal. Depending on when their b-days fall, they could both be in the same graduating class. He could have been born in May 1990 while she was born in July 1991. Therefor, he is 16 but she will still be 14 for at least another half of a month. Now, none of this information was given. All I'm saying is that the 2 year gap (until more info is given there) can not be considered the biggest problem."
notsarc,"It's a lot more than what you've come up with. What evidence do you have that indicates the Iraq population wasn't heavily armed? As for the Taliban, you're confusing Afghanistan with Iraq."
notsarc,"Right so...1) God will kill you before he gives you a chance to repent? Thus sending you straight to hell. I like that!2) God seems to make life unfair for most everyone. Hey, even in America. Consider in America, and extrememly religious state, you still have the highest homocide rates out of ALL the western countries. (I'm pretty sure of this.)3) Left behind? So, wait. The riegtous go the heaven, and everyone else remains leading a normal, religion free life on earth? Hmmm...4) Hebrews?5) Can it help? The gospels tell a story about a carpenter who lived 2000 years ago, and may or may not have been the son of god. Yeah, I can see how that can help. Why can't I worship the Flying Spaghetti Monster?"
notsarc,my question is: who's funding this?  no sane investor would give him the money needed to run such a operation especially in israel.
notsarc,"i asked on another thread, but it fits here as well... is there a distinction between the absence of belief in x and the belief in the absence of x? before, i suggested that i couldn't see a distinction, but after pondering it for awhile, i believe there is a distinction between the two: if one asserts that there is no god (or gods), this is a belief in the absence of god. if one makes no assertions one way or another (even internally), then this would be an absence of belief. i'm not certain into which 'side' atheism would fall, though i believe it would have to be the former, and therefore, a belief. the latter sounds more like agnosticism to me. but perhaps someone else can better clarify this topic."
notsarc,"no your question isn't about 'right to life', but more appropriate your questioned should be 'do they have a right to continue life'? and my answer is absolutely yes!  at the living single cell, when the unique properties of a complete human being is created, it is living, not dead. who has a right to kill another human being's living existance? no one has that right in a civil society, but we haven't reached that society yet, but one day maybe."
notsarc,"isly, where are those who hate all christians that are members of congregations led by those radical preachers that abhor homosexualality?  where are all those puported 'christians' who have been misled by radical preachers into hating homosexuals? the country has far more to fear from them than it does from a black preacher who dares to speak truth to power."
notsarc,"why do you assume the poster didn't use birth control? they said nothing about birth control; only a statement on being pregnant and having an abortion. also, why do you make any assumptions about suffering? according to the poster, suffering was avoided. condoms are not 100% effective. a childhood friend's younger sibling was the product of a failed condom, among other factors. nine months and nine weeks are completely different."
notsarc,"Hello, ungerdunn.Hmm. It is possible that I will be living in Oklahoma in 2006. How easy is it to get to Houston from there?I was a Peace Corps volunteer in Tanzania. One of my biggest regrests is that I never made it to Olduvai Gorge. It would have been interesting to pay a visit to the ancestral homeland!"
notsarc,"persecution on political grounds? we are talking about a kingpin of russian organized crime here. he has been indicted in russia for fraud and political corruption (bribing politicians) and there is absolutly no question that he is guilty as sin. now he is hiding in britain and actively planning a violent coup in order to overthrow the elected government...and he lays all this out to a british newspaper.  political persecution if he returns? probably not. execution for treason? that one seems more likely.  in the extradition rhetoric arena, the russians are looking a lot more reasonable then the british."
notsarc,"this i do not agree with. i cannot see how the court could rule in favor of doma based on 14th amendment protections. as far as the law goes, the marriage license from couple a from state 1 is the same as the license from couple b from the same state. how could it be constitutional to refuse to recognize the marriage license from couple a, yet recognize the marriage license from couple b from the same state? that is unconstitutional."
notsarc,"So what if he dislikes science? If he believes something else, he has the right to believe that way. My problem here is that he shows more closed-mindedness to the viewpoints of others."
notsarc,"so you have no idea if any states removed interracial marriage laws without court involvement?  and i'll just answer your question then which was (as you restated) [does] anybody kn[o]w of a state that had removed interracial marriage laws without court involvement. that answer is, yes, i know of a state that hard removed interracial marriage laws without court involvement.  glad i could help."
notsarc,"there's a fair few problems with this. off the top of my head... what happens when the pregnancy is accidental, and neither the mother nor the father want a child? what consequences would there be for a mother who didn't want to give the name of the father? would there be any? why is only the father punished? having consensual sex is just that - consensual on the part of both people. if it isn't consensual, rape laws already cover it and if it is consensual and a pregnancy occurs, why punish only one of the consenting individuals? on a more fundamental level: what evidence do you have that having an abortion is 'a mortal sin'? why should the courts be concerned with preventing a religious concept?"
notsarc,"well, the actual personality of the computer is in the hard drive. ram really isn't anything but a notebook, and the motherboard is more of a nervous system. so the processor and hardrive is the mind- the processor being the modivator, and the hard drive being the memory. if i were to take the intel p3 out and place an athlon xp 3000+ in it's place, would the computer be a different computer? no. it would be the same computer."
notsarc,"i'm sorry, but i find this completely ridiculous and unfounded. i can see (remotely) how abortion might be considered anti-woman (although it is of course anti-life before being anything else), but how has christianity directly sanctioned the questions of women's suffrage, spousal abuse, property ownership, social status, etc.? by the way, do you consider fundamentalists to be the best representatives of a religion? i am catholic, and i believe i understand the dogmas and principles of my faith quite enougth to say that nothing of what you have mentioned (except abortion, because it has nothing to do with women's rights) are viewed positively by the catholic church, or ever have been. please explain with details."
notsarc,"How do you define evolution? If you don't see any, then you aren't using the definition used by evolutionary biologists. The question is who should define the vocabulary of evolutionary biologist, evolutionary biologists or creationists?"
notsarc,"daniel dennett asks, how did just one species, homo sapiens, acquire the numinous perspective that can have such a profound influence on people's lives? he seems to think that religions evolved and originally served a 'primitive' philosophical intention - such as explaining the hidden 'causes' of natural events in pre-scientific societies. to give just one example: the rise and fall of the tides were observed, but not understood. so the phenomena were attributed to the power of a god (or gods) etc. i think this is a pretty commonplace answer, but not necessarily wrong.  why has religion survived the scepticism of the intellectual enlightenment and the rational attacks of science? the idea that some fundamental 'psychic need' in humanity is satisfied by having religious beliefs seems (to me) the most promising speculation."
notsarc,"why didn't you think of it? it took me no time at all to find the actual article, who authored it, and how to contact them. from what i have seen of your post, you rarely think at all."
notsarc,"Says who? People have the right to say anything they want to. There is NO right to not be judged by someone. It doesn't matter if something someone else does affects you and me or not. People can think whatever they want about other people. People can also SAY what they want. As far as a personal philosophy of behavior, I agree with you--what you're saying is a good rule to live by. But I can't agree people have no right to condemn or judge others."
notsarc,"really? congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; sounds like a requirement to be neutral to me. it could be rephrased: 'don't meddle with religion! do not regulate. neither promote nor inhibit.' why would anyone have a problem with this? and we both know that the limitation of government regulate of rights and liberties is read today, thanks to the 14th amendment, as applying to all legislative authorities in the us, not just congress. no state legislature can establish a state religion either."
notsarc,"What? Was she supposed to have him executed on sight or something? You have no proof that Palin condoned of this, or if she even heard it among the chatter for that matter."
notsarc,but you have not shown how she would be harmed by equal marriage? i have shown that her definition infringes upon my religious freedom. if gay marriage becomes a reality then in no way does it infringe upon her in any way. would you care to explain how gay marriage infringes upon her in any way? it is her heterosexual privledge and her sence of entitlement that she is protecting not marriage.
notsarc,"On an internet forum why is that so important? The bigger man usually need not find it necessary to prove he is, but is secure in his knowledge he is or is big enough to realize when he isn't and adjust accordingly.My guess is this is not the only place this happens. These things happen, you fall, you get up, people laugh, you move on, you see someone fall you can laugh or help them up. Just depends on who you want to be.Sorry I am a sucker for empty milk crates. Can't seem to walk by one without jumping on and taking her for a spin."
notsarc,"They're going to say no? CA tried that. Tell me the last time utility costs were reduced by a state agency. It's a rubber stamp and nothing else. We travel in different investment circles. I don't know anyone putting their money in US long-term syndication on the equity side not associated with health care real property and a petrochemical plant can be a 40-year useful life situation. What's your take on the US economy in 5, 10 and 20+ years? Good enough to put up the money for what may well be surplus refining capacity before useful life term is reached? Enviros or not, if the return is there money always has its own way of doing things. Corporations are awash in cash. Liquidity has been the name of the game for some time, but there are always bridge buyers."
notsarc,"does the enormous pay of ceos help the economy? probably not. would prohibiting enormous pay of ceos (threatening to fine or imprison people if they violated an arbitrary cap on salaries) help the economy? certainly not. is rawls argument correct, and all that remains is for us to work out the details of a totalitarian state to enforce his ideals? no."
notsarc,"so lets ban cars... they kill people... and think all the money could go to public transportation. also we should ban baseball bats as thats the obvious next step in weaponry... don't forget archery... can't have the subjects have any of that... since we are taking away all these weapons to coddle the masses, will the government be disarming too? i see a need for both kinds of weapons as a freeman."
notsarc,Why should every pro-lifer have to be an adoptive parent in order to have credibility?This is akin to saying that every pro-choicer should have to have an abortion -- or at least face that choice personally -- in order to be a credible pro-choicer.
notsarc,"Think about this? Do you support abolishing the Senate? In the Senate, a vote from Rhode Island is worth more than a vote from California.Also, the US is not a democracy. It is a republic. You are guaranteed an equal say in the House of Representatives."
notsarc,I don't understand this business of the UK and England at all. It seems to me that somebody has a chip on their shoulder. Who cares? Chomsky is not as bad as the terrorists. That's an obvious fact. What is equally obvious is that he provides aid and comfort to the enemy and that's the definition of a traitor.
notsarc,"The same could be said of Clinton.Tell me. How do people learn if you insist on covering up these situations?If a person like Sanford isn't exposed to his own medicine, how will he (or others) not recognize how it tastes?Furthermore, I find your perspective a little baffling.What he said ""many years ago""? Is that something he should be embarrassed of, because he was wrong?Or should he be embarrassed cause he got caught?Cause the standard of not cheating on your wife is not a bad standard. It's a good standard.We have too many politicians who look out for their own interests, and say things just for political gain not to take it seriously."
notsarc,"poverty may seem insurmountable today, but wouldn't water-born disease have seemed that way a century ago? yet we are not many years away from everyone in the world having access to clean water and sanitation."
notsarc,"Making up numbers again georged? Care to post some links to this data?In 2005 Israel received 2.5 billion, most of it being foreign military financing...there is some more they get though so your 5 billion might be right. As for the 28 billion in 2002...I know that is wrong. I recall a 200 million dollar thing, but I don't know if it went through.The rest of your numbers are probably overstated as well....you have a bad habit of doing so."
notsarc,"who appointed you forum moderator? i just asked obvious child what he thought should be done with iran? i never claimed to have all the answers, but i do share my opinions like everyone else here does.  seig heil to you too!"
notsarc,"So what is being monitored by the ribosome? Information. Material representations (amino acid sequence vs DNA sequence) of information. But, it does not only monitor it, it manipulates it as a means to an end... fidelity."
notsarc,"It's probably defensive to some extent on both sides. A lot of atheists I've run into seem to be out to prostlytize as well--they are basically evangelists for the atheist way of thinking. Religiously atheist, you might say. They're looking for opportunities to assert the atheist message. And I've read some pretty darn hateful things said about Christianity right here in these forums, and just chalking it up to be ""defending"" or ""kicking back"" doesn't really fly. Who knows who threw the first punch? It's to the point that it doesn't really matter anymore, because both sides should be showing respect."
notsarc,"don't you see the foolishness of that based on your own personal life experiences as a sentient human being? no. you were the one who posted that something does not need to be sentient in order to be alive. why, then, do you distinguish between two things that are obviously both alive, both of which are parasites on their hosts?"
notsarc,"i've spoken favorably of religious believers who stand up for gay rights against a tyrannical version of christianity. what more do you want? blood? look, i disagree with the entire concept of religion. my view is that when religious believers support something that's right, they do it despite their religion, because it makes sense to them on the basis of humanitarian instincts, not religious ones. maybe sometimes their religion coincides with humanitarianism. all i can say to that is i wish it would do it more often than it does in practice!"
notsarc,"now you are just playing games. you claimed the institution isn't being harmed. i said it really is--what else would you call it if the instution as we know would be done away with? the evidence is that if the institution as we know it is done away with for something else, it will no be there anymore. that's how it's harmed. if marriage is opened up to change everytime a group with a different sort of relationship comes along wanting it to be redefined, it would become something much more open-ended, broadened to meaninglessness. if that's not damage to an institution, i don't know what is."
notsarc,"should we clear up what we're talking about at all? i think adultery is legal in 24 states, and i'm pretty sure adultery laws have been pretty much completely unenforced since world war ii. i don't know of any states where a polygamous relationship with no marriage involved is illegal. now, certainly having multiple marriage licenses is illegal..."
notsarc,"Do you have any evidence for that? And still, I don't know what you mean by kind."
notsarc,"Well, you didn't have my experiences, now did you? Each woman who has an abortion coul have innumerous circumstances and experiences."
notsarc,"How about the individual's offspring? Is a ""subtract 10 years"" gene encoded in the genome just because of one marriage?Still no evidence."
notsarc,"You benefit from all of these. They may not be direct benefits or even benefits you want but when it exists we all benefit. Frankly, the IRS is just an idiotic one. Your whole argument only works if you have the IRS to enforce these policies. Could we go without SS and Public education? Probably, but I prefer a system where society decides on what is a ""public good"" and we go with that."
notsarc,"Galatians 6:7 Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.The whole concept of ""reap what you sow"" is a CHRISTIAN concept.And now you're claiming it's flawed?While I feel the need to continually reiterate that what this guy did in harming others was WRONG (primarily to avoid the trolls from misrepresenting my point), the validity of the generic concept of ""reap what you sow"" is amazingly poignant.People typically don't just go nuts and harm people for no reason.Columbine saw the kids trying to harm other kids who harassed them.While some people may be jumping the gun in trying to assign ""sowing"", I am also amazed that others are so unwilling to inspect the question of whether or not the church involved truly did ""sow""..."
notsarc,I agree. What is the point? Felons with firearms do not bother with CCW licenses.
notsarc,listen if they can be nasty to me i can be equally nasty to them. what part of equailty do you not understand? equality one way or the other that is my over riding concern right and wrong are secondary.
notsarc,"scientists found out that brains that think differently also work differently? wow... i consider humans biological machines (with experience being the 'software'), so of course brains will be different. but i do not really agree with the 'conclusions' drawn. with the 'traits' shown."
notsarc,"Oooh, I see. Only some presidents get experience, eh? And you think that Bush learns from his mistakes?! He doesn't even admit he makes any!Let me guess, only Republican presidents learn from their first terms, don't they? Pfft."
notsarc,so what you're saying is that you can't?  as a political move to satisfy the pro-life constituents that put them in office.
notsarc,"i just don't see that being a huge factor. it might help some, but if my goal was to improve foreign relations reigning in spending would not be the first approach i would take. can you expand on your reasoning? the start of that chain is belligerence, not out of control spending. seems to me that if you want to control spending you should work on foreign relations. that way you get into fewer wars, and when you must fight you have others helping and sharing the cost."
notsarc,"Why do conservatives support conservatives? Paul's theology found favor with the Christians that won amongst the early churches. Paul was not considered an Apostle by the original 11 and Barnabas. Luke doesn't have him meet a risen Jesus only Paul says he did. His first missionary trek was a failure and the next two he was not equal with Barnabas.But the Apostles did not teach the same as Paul, similiar but not the same."
notsarc,"What's your claim? That the seasonal molt of arctic foxes is evolution or that it is not? As usual, your responses show muddled thinking."
notsarc,"originally posted by easyrider  would they have died for a lie, if christ were not resurrected? not likely. like i said, i doubt that very much."
notsarc,"Yes, do you? It's in a country with no medical facilities, no sterile place to get it done. A country full of HIV and AIDS. I wouldn't be surprised if these mothers had HIV/AIDS and knew they'd leave their child an orphan."
notsarc,"Gun hater pilot's gun control laws failed the law abiding citizens at columbine!Who should be held accountable for this failure? Well, since the government passed the gun control laws that gun hater pilot wanted the government should be held responsible. That means the tax payer will pay for gun haters pilot gun free bs!Gun hater pilot wants to disarm the law abiding citizens so criminals like the ones at columbine can freely walk around and kill their victims!Gun hater pilot wants to disarm the law abiding citizens so criminals like the ones on 9/11 that used box cutters to take over airplanes crowed with people!"
notsarc,"Well, I am a parent too; three sons. So what is your point? You think I am incapable of reproducing? I have their birth certificates. emoticonXRolleyes ""Bible""??? I hold Robert A. Heinland in high regard too. And Ayn Rand. And James Mitchner. And William Shakespeare. And Isaac Asimov. So what is your point?So, I should also assume you have only had sex with the intention of producing a child; in the missionary position only?????????????"
notsarc,"well can you point to an instance, either in canada or the united kingdom, where the government mandated firearm registries have been instrumental in solving any number of vicious and felonious crimes? i'm not talking about catching people who let their registration lapse, or those who told their spouses about the location of their gun locker keys, i'm talking about serious crimes like murder and robbery and others. can you provide us with any evidence that would point to how the registries have helped solve any such happenings?"
notsarc,"ooo, the slippery slope argument! always a classic. the right to not be discriminated against based on her sexual orientation perhaps? what part of the dress code was she going to violate? she was going to wear formal wear. it's not like she was going to show up in ripped jeans and a slipknot t-shirt. rules designed to exclude her. their wishes don't supersede her rights."
notsarc,"Maybe you are having trouble with the concept of ""low premium, high deductible"". That means the monthly payments (premiums) are low, and the deductible is higher (cost you actually pay for services). This shouldn't be a problem. How often do you actually use your health insurance? I use mine very rarely (not at all in the last year). It appears that what Bush is trying to do is get insurance coverage to low income folks without a multi trillion dollar price tag (like kerrys plan carries). This isn't a bad thing, and I am not even a bush supporter."
notsarc,"What issues? You drivel on about breasts forming on lizards (even though the most primitive milk secretors we have today don't have anatomically distinct mammary glands, and the earliest mammals evolved from reptiles not remotely like lizards), then triumphantly crown your straw man with what you seem to think is a knock-down point about nerve connections.Yes, SS, the most primitive milk-secreting structures we know are modified sweat glands; your incredulity does not alter that fact one iota. And guess what? Sweat glands have nerve connections to the hypothalamus..."
notsarc,"third degree? dono posted something that confused me, so i was asking for clarification. of what concern is it to anyone whether gay people marry? adopt? what concern is it of mine whether female infants have their vaginas sewn up, for that matter? why should anyone care whether women have abortions, as well? again, where is the line drawn between concern over an issue and obsession? yay for you? there were black people who thought slavery was just fine, too, so i see this as evidence of nothing more than your own muddy thinking."
notsarc,"If substantial shouldn't be a percentage, how should it be quantified? How would you determine whether or not their prop 8 efforts were a substantial portion of their activities? And yes, as the law is currently written, it does matter how large the church is. I would suggest that those that don't like it lobby to get it changed."
notsarc,i see alot of links to videos on this thread? but here's one that grabs my attention. i'm sure that this will shed some light on the issue.
notsarc,then what did you mention? compensation against stolen goods is insurance against theft.
notsarc,"i'd say out of the 6 billion people on earth at least 4 billion of them are richer right now than they would be had the economic systems never changed since the era of globalization began. i don't think the number is as small as 3 people. how doesn't it lead to stability. think china and their reform to capitalism and westernization. are them more of a threat to the world as a communist nation or as a globalized nation? it will be stabilizing to have them westernize. however, it isn't necessarily good. yeah i can see what you mean. the people are just about ready to burst because the us and canada depend so much on each other. nor did i. whew, we agree on something :) isn't that the truth."
notsarc,how exactly is terrorism not a criminal act? i don't see what you're getting at.
notsarc,"Here's a question; which one split from the other? Which one is the ""new"" being? None of them are. If I get a cake and slice into two exact pieces, which one is the ""new"" slice? They are both equally new."
notsarc,"surely, we can only 'guesstimate' how many living species have escaped our attention ? but how probable is it that only 1% of all the species that ever existed escaped extinction ?  i think your point about mass extinctions may be a key to what has puzzled me."
notsarc,"so you argue that for some women, abortion is the 'easy way out', and that those women choose to abort, take the easy way out as you say, for arbitrary reasons? could you please reiterate these reasons here (preferably in an enumerated list) and explain why they should be considered arbitrary? indeed. but we've established that supposing a higher profile in the media in no way entails an actual increase in incidents.  so i'll repeat the question, hearsay aside, upon what evidence do you base the assertion that more women are abandoning infants?"
notsarc,"islam is no more built on hate, burder and death than christianity is. do i have to remind you of the inquisition, the holy land wars, the witch burnings, etc.? if you try to claim that what some islamic people have done represents the whole religion, then i can do the same with those things that i listed, only for the christian faith. and don't even get started again on satan being a fallen angel - yes, we know about your beliefs that angels do not have free will, and yet rebelled against god, so we don't need to go into any more of that garbage."
notsarc,"Actually, if you count the Kinsey 4,5, and 6's you get 18%. It's 10% for the 5s and 6s. That'd be the people that prefer the same sex over opposite for the most part. 2,3,and 4 would be those who are bi and lean slightly one way or the other. 0 and 1 are people who pretty much always choose opposite sex over same. 0 and 6 are very rare though. Anyway, 10% of people are a 5 or 6. About 3% are a full 6.Could Jesus have been asexual? In certain philosophies asexuality is considered a sign of enlightenment. For instance, after becoming enlightened, the Buddha rejected sexual desires."
notsarc,So the stats come from John Lott.... Wasn't he the one who got caught making up statistics and impersonated a woman for three years to support the pro-gun cause?  http://articles.latimes.com/2006/may/31/opinion/oe-wiener31 http://whoismaryrosh.com/  .
notsarc,"YOU LIAR.You are distorting the truth the same way Moore did. The truth is the NRA event was planned 1 year before the killings in Littleton. The truth is the NRA rally was canceled excpet for the officers meetings which is required by LAW to NOT BE CANCELED. HESTON said ""FROM MY COLD DEAD HANDS"" in North Carolina 1 year later.And what transcript are you talking about? The transcript is posted above. What big pro-gun rally are you talking about in Denver. Do you mean the one that NEVER happened?"
notsarc,"i am familiar with both men; and my posts sound very lockean, which if you really knew locke you would know is true. remember previously in this thread (that is, when you were travelling these parts as 'bhbcu64') where i said that there is no right to control one's body? or where i said there is no right to suicide? that is locke 101."
notsarc,"I got ya, but I still disagree. if free will doesnt exist, then why should I make an effort to do anything? if I am destined to be wealthy, then no matter how lazy I am today, I'll be wealthy sometime down the road. and if Im destined to poor, no amount of hard work and diligence on my part can change that. why wouldnt I just drift along life and allow destiny to take me where I will inevitably end up?"
notsarc,"you choose to distort my post by your suggestion about a 'primitive land': i neither said nor intended to imply as much. try not to let your tendency towards political correctness seek hidden meanings in what are attempts a giving a balanced account of historical events. british imperialism happened: it was not a completely baleful phenomenon. it had some beneficial outcomes even if they were not intended. english happens to be the lingua franca of science, economics, etc. i don't know whether it's uniquely suited to it. do you ? it's obvious that other languages have an input: i'm not making a judgement about them."
notsarc,"how did you private insurer determine the coverage in your plan? do they ever make case-by-case determinations not to cover something? i strongly urge you not only to read the house bill and the upcoming senate bill, but also to read your own health insurance plan, in detail, fine print and all, as well as to look into their record of denying claims. it's one of those things that most people don't realize is a problem until it affects them directly, at which point it's too late."
notsarc,walking-fish: has anyone ever observed two atoms combining to form a molecule? has anyone ever counted out 6.02 x 10^23 molecules to see if they really make up a mole? has anyone ever watched the earth for a year from outer space to see if it really does go around the sun? has anyone ever seen electrons in a copper wire when an eletric current is passed through it? all scientific disciplines are held together by theories which are inferences about things we cannot directly observe. what is it about science that you don't understand?
notsarc,"hold on there. have you read the amendment? if all of our legistlators passed laws based on single incidents, our nanny government would be exponentially more intrusive than it already is.  now i don't know this woman's story any more than you do. all you know is that at least one defense contractor has a clause in it's employee contract banning an employee from shoooting for the brass ring in a jury trial. it doesn't state that the rapists can't be prosecuted."
notsarc,"i have heard that you can easily find a marriage license copy online and without having to pay a fee. is this true? i would love to get a copy of my deceased parents' marriage license if i can. it would be a nice thing to frame and to keep on the wall to remember them by. so, can you find copies of marriage licenses online or is this just an urban myth?"
notsarc,"didn't intend to, he was in fact an enlisted soldier in ww1. my implication was so what? he was far better known as a failed artist."
notsarc,"i think you're missing the point. why would you want to keep people under control? to prevent them from harming other people. the men who created the commandments and the bible i believe had good intentions. they wanted to give people a reason to live their lives well, and the bible was the best and most intelligent thinking of the time (not modern, ancient). it was a good idea, however people started looking past the 'love thy neighbor' stuff and started focusing on unimportant things like homosexuality and abortion. so, my question is why is homosexuality a sin?"
notsarc,"And what did I say?   I quoted the title of the video, said ""Enjoy"" and labeled the link ""link""  So how is saying ""enjoy"" and ""link"" which were MY words mockery? The only thing that suggests otherwise is the VIDEO's Title, which I did not create."
notsarc,a lot of people are adopted... my science teacher was adopted. he had a successful military career that ended with him as a war planner helping to plan the gulf war... he had a successful chiropratic practice too. what you said is not so true. should he have been denied his life because of some emotional trama he might bave later in life? i don't think so.
notsarc,"Almost? Usually, that is true, and it involves selection between populations. However, there are often times when some of a population is better able to survive. Those times, selection occurs within a population."
notsarc,"why can't skeptics be reactionary? don't you know people who automatically distrust everything said by bush, or by liberals, or any group you like? why should skeptics be any more objective than the average population? some will be very objective, some will be very reactionary, most will fill in the spectrum in between. i belive that the majority are in the middle, you seem to be focusing on the reactionary end."
notsarc,"And who is the 'WE' that we trust? The scientists or the theologians, who disagree with each other?   I am curious for it on my own account.. and not willing just to accept someone's authority saying it happened one way or another."
notsarc,why are you trying to turn this into a religious debate? no one said anything about finding jesus. all you have done is show your anti-god prejudice.
notsarc,"how so? i would think 'they shall surely be put to death' (as the av has it) is a commandment, and clearly addressed to the faithful. how can one pick and choose what to take as a commandment and what is god, for want of a better way of putting it, talking to himself!"
notsarc,"so you get to whine and moan and complain (lie) that i didn't address your points, then when i challenge you to support your points against my counterarguments, you say that you don't need to. you're a hypocrite, archie.  ignore it? bhbcu64 made a valid point and made significant elaborations. the only responses we've seen are 'you're wrong' with no explanation, and two 'why does this follow?'s, apparently due to ignorance of that pesky little thing called law."
notsarc,"there is plenty of evidence on what kind of marriage the clintons have. i am not making this up out of whole cloth, i am referring to the jr. senator's own words in her memoir 'living history': hillary rodham clinton felt 'dumbfounded, heartbroken and outraged' when she learned of the affair and said that she could 'hardly breathe' when she learned the rumors of the affair were true. 'gulping for air, i started crying and yelling at him: 'what do you mean? why did you lie to me?' mrs clinton writes.  doesn't sound like such a swingin good time ey what? but don't take my word for it, go down to the library and read pg 502.  i stand by my previous thesis."
notsarc,"is that why when everyone turned their back to bush to cheer the couple, bush just sat there with his hands folded looking impatient? what was really sickening to me was when everyone put ink on their fingers. they totally cheapened the bravery of the iraqis. none of these pissants waited in line where they might be shot. they didn't walk home hoping no one would see the ink and kill them. and they certainly aren't in the middle of the war. it was truly sick for them to have that ink on their fingers."
notsarc,"of course i know that i could be wrong but i would have to be proven wrong through rational arguement, not just claims. have you ever stopped to think that perhaps you could be wrong? either way, we already discussed this issue of whether people can have opinions about abortion law. perhaps you are having a 'senior moment' and don't remember our discussion. i really don't feel like repeating this whole discussion all over again for your benefit. indeed, you do seem to repeat your questions quite often. if you don't like someone's answer, don't just repeat the question - address their answer. if you don't remember our discussion, it started pretty much around post #861. unless you have something new to say that we didn't already discuss, then i think we pretty much covered it and left it at a disagreement."
notsarc,"i assume you take the position life begins at conception and biological potential is sufficient to claim to be a human. then why do we stop at a fertilized egg? if you mean potential, is supposed to become, or posses the correct dna to one day be then birth control would fit under birth control as would masturbation for you abortion is the immoral act of killing a human being. if we say based on results then killing is killing. the reasons are irrelevant, there is no difference between abortion, capital punishment or self defense.  yes these are extreme, but its where your position leads. at some point we make a choice and say that goes to far, but then we are back at choice and what is to much for one and not enough for another."
notsarc,"where is here? you don't seem to want to display your location. we all know there's more than one way to become an american citizen. that said, as an american citizen, english is the native tongue. it's the primary language taught in american schools and it's how our government communicates with its citizenry. i'm not really interested in debating this topic with you, it probably should be a thread unto itself. i think dono was merely pointing out that if you want to make a 'snippy' reply, it carries more weight when correctly spelled."
notsarc,"here's the thing about stem cell research... how would stem cell research go against the christian faith. does it go against christ to heal the sick? medicnes could improve greatly with the use of stem cell research. i'll quicky mention 2 people (1 still alive and one dead) who could have (or could be) greatly healed with stem cell research. for one, christerpher reeves could have still been alive if stem cell research could have been done. michael j. fox (and others with parkingson's (sp?) disease) could be greatly helped with the use of stem cell research. oh, and one other thing. bush has no family values. not just tearing apart gay families but also straight families. he sends husbands/fathers, wives/mother's, sons and daughters over to fight a war that we have no business in being in anyway."
notsarc,"just a question, can someone show me where symbiote posted at all on the thread?  4forums.com political debates and polls - search results he's got 4 posts in the past day. none of which are about what cashburnrate/yankee fan/roesgen08 says they are.  sorry giantorio for cluttering the forum. and thanks cashburnrate/yankee fan/roesgen08, you just proved my point. when i prove you are wrong, you just change your argument and insult me for failing to prove your new argument you just created. you did this as yankee fan on lw. you did this here as cashburn. you're doing it again as roesgen08. same exact story."
notsarc,"most parents today don't buy their kids toy guns and certainly not realistic replicas. why don't you just stop defending unscrupulous merchants that sell dangerous toys in violation of federal law? cops are human, they make mistakes. easy for you, the armchair patriot, to criticize."
notsarc,aren't gun shows rather controlled environments? i've heard weapons for sale are required to be unloaded and customers commonly have to pass through metal detectors and submit to a pat down.
notsarc,"yea...i'd say we're on a downhill slide. do you agree with talkorigins that most mutations (like 99%) lose information, lose specificity? mutations are destructive entities. they demolish and break down what was there. granted some of these may be beneficial but ulitmately the gene has lost information. and since selection works on the level of the whole organism, it cannot stop the loss of information on the molecular level. not only that, but natural selection has an i.q. of exactly zero -- as do random mutations -- so i believe the only way for the genome to go is downward. and if the only way for the genome to go is downward, then common sense says that neodarwinism is wrong. it's not just unlikely...it's not just improbably -- it's dead wrong and the whole hypothesis must be rejected."
notsarc,"in what passages does jesus refer to his junior partner? i'm not saying he did not, rather, i'm not recalling off the top of my head any specific mention of the holy ghost by jesus."
notsarc,"sure, no doubt. but, there are ways to be absolutely 100% sure that you don't get pregnant. the obvious way is not to have sex, but i know you won't settle for abstinance as an answer. that's way too religious for this site i suppose. obviously i cannot propose that no one have sex unless they want children. if someone doesn't want to ever have children and is willing to undergo an operation (abortion) to remove the possibility, why can they not simply have a different operation before practicing casual sex? this is true within marriage as well."
notsarc,"so?? it was still a speech made for the purpose of political support of gay marriage. yes, i watched it. agreed. it was for the purpose of appealing to emotion (to a political end). no, but my point is that neither does the sanitized 'norman rockwell' image that some gay-pride proponents want projected by linking to videos such as the one here. it might give the impression that gay pride is merely some 'family-friendly' movement without the reality of the very dark side to it."
notsarc,"which is pretty much normal for arch. do you think he realizes that many muslims in europe are cultural muslims? that many who emigrate to europe are quite disgusted with what they see back in their homelands? the rise of gay muslims in europe is quite interesting as to how they have fully adopted the views of their adopted european homeland and are afraid of returning to their original home countries. the notion that arch has that once a muslim always a crazy muslim is pretty nuts, but nothing but typical from a guy who thought that tv props are good evidence for 6,000 year old acts of creation."
notsarc,"You two are on the same side, you just don't know it yet. And you're both friends of mine so shake hands and make up willya? emoticonXHohoemoticonXGoodAnd yes's video IS very disturbing because it shows that in a time of natural catastrophe's or mass turmoil, our Government will confiscate guns from law abiding citizens. During the LA riots after the Rodney King verdict, the Gov't ordered all gun shops to lock down and to stop selling ammunition. So even law abiding citizens with legally registered weapons couldn't buy ammo to protect themselves."
notsarc,"how can god be there before time? you can't get before time, as the concept of before is irrelevant without time. even at the very beginnings of the universe time was not one of the curled up spatial dimensions."
notsarc,"pay attention. age of consent is still the topic and point. if teen pregnancy is reduced to statistically acceptable levels through education and contraception with medical risk being a negligible five-decimal point factor, that would position teen sex emotional distress as a good/bad societal interpretation designated by non-teens, would it not? which would negate chronological age of consent for legal sex to a non-status unless those non-teens making the laws had another agenda."
notsarc,"appears i hit a nerve? i don't know why you put in the 'personal baggage' line...but ok. as for you not using the word 'hatred'...i admit you didn't, i did. if you say you don't then i'll take your word for it but your posts on these forums seem to make me think otherwise."
notsarc,"Not needed? It is evolution. The collor of the moths is genetic - caused by 2 alleles of a single gene. The frequencies of those alleles were observed to change in the populations of moths over many generations. It is by definition, evolution."
notsarc,"I do appreciate your point while I disagree on principle. I guess it boils down to the fact that even if I believed in a God I couldn't accept that He would command us to suppress our true innate nature. Why would He makes us that way and then expect such a thing? Christians especially are indoctrinated from early on with the notion that that is exactly what God commands. To suppress a good many natural inclinations. To accept that we are sinful by nature and need to be punished, our nature brought to heel."
notsarc,"are you saying you only have a hard time having compassion for the gay victims of sexually transmitted illness? if, so that just shows your anti-gay prejudice. what difference does that make? everyone who has aids is a victim. in some communities and in other countries, the majority who have it are straight. against the victims from the largest social group of victims in each jurisdiction? this is nothing more than prejudice and destructive political agenda.  i would hope there are other, better, human instincts inside of you."
notsarc,"if you think marriage is sacred then why are you trying to change what it is? i can't say this enough times...marriage is a word that describes a union between man and women. no one created the word marriage and then decided what it would apply to. someone saw and event and gave this event a word...this would be marriage. this 'event' has been sacred since as long as we have records to show. and now, some wish to make it sacred for themselves while destroying the sacred institute that the majority of us wish to keep."
notsarc,"If that were true, why are there millions of miscarriages each year? I don't believe a word of it."
notsarc,"Why is saying that many things conflict with the well being of Society at large and bans them to the disappointment of those who endorse such activities. Consider rape, murder, incest and sodomy as good historical examples of such taboo activities, taken by you as an inditement of all gay people JSD ? You seem to take any moral stance or argument I make very personally, as if I'm accusing you of being those things. You work very hard to read into, demonize and condemn everything I say as if it is intended as a personal attack. You really need to work on that."
notsarc,"that is not much of an excuse to ignore 13 pages of archives from cbs is it? cbs news investigates - cbs news there are reports from every major newspaper that reported on the scandal...which all did, some more than others. poor excuse wanna try again? emoticonxgood something tells me you don't want brightbart and fox news, nor the l.a. times nor any source to report the truth, is that about it star gazer?"
notsarc,"avoiding what question, penfold? emoticonxbanghead how is asking iangb to take it to the 'challenger's corner' an avoidance? i see it as a chance to amplify the discussion. at any rate, it's a lot easier to answer a question if you know what is being asked. so,... feel free to repeat the question that you are accusing me of trying to avoid."
notsarc,"fantasy,fairy tale, wild imagination, adsurd , silly , ridiculous,fabricated .unsupported by one single observation or experiment , unsubstantiated. i do agree we don't speak the same language. no one will explain to me how one steals public information, i am confused. how is work shady? how would you define shady as opposed to rather shady when it refers to work? i thought bookmaking etc. was shady but i am old fashioned i guess. please educate me. is this a meaningfull reprimand coming from someone who believes one can observe a mind? you still have refused to explain that and i was so anxious to hear it. please go on."
notsarc,is homophobia an instinct? because i really have no clue where it came from...
notsarc,"that speaks a lot about you and shows other posters they shouldn't take what you say at face value. yes it does. if i go before congress and say 'being gay is a choice without a doubt made at age 11' and had no evidence than i should be laughed at. same thing as this woman. she makes a claim with no evidence and reason to lie. this makes you not credible.  than a legislative body? while probably true, this is sad because newspapers have none."
notsarc,"an innocent person can be convicted of a crime--i thought that was what the topic was about. just because they are convicted, doesn't mean they are 100% responsible, guilty, etc for that crime-but if they are convicted then in the eyes of the judicial system--they are guilty. that is why these innocent people are put in prison for 20 years--they are convicted of a crime. i was trying to say that with dna used in forensics, then maybe the dna study blood stain other than the victims might save a person from going to prison on circumstantial evidence. okay, everytime i make a post i get my arse jumped on--what is it with you people? like i said, if the person isn't convicted, then they will not be murdered in the electric chair, or by lethal injection.  comprende' ?"
notsarc,what about evolution has been observed?  i think it has been more theorized (if thats a word) then anything else. creating theories for theories and so on.
notsarc,"why? you seem to think you can come here and trash everyone else's religion and go on about how your religion is the 'true' religion and when someone else tries to tell how stupid your argument is, you tell them to stop making fun of it. and why do you care about how old people here are anyway?"
notsarc,"the top 10% of people in this country pay 67% of the taxes. most of the money from the middle class? no, not at all."
notsarc,"I argue against them with regards to whatever argument they muster. Do we have any of those on this message board? Because from what I can see, it's primarily the ""religious"" argument counter..."
notsarc,"by 'church' ... do you mean the group of people who are christian (ie. congregation) ? the institution of church? to orthodox, the church is a living earthly embodiment of jesus christ. the role of orthodox is to be like god... by following his example. we are called to return to him, but we are separated from him by sin. we are living icons of god."
notsarc,And can you please tell me the difference between nonrandom variation and directed variation? I'd also like a link to verify what you say. Thank you. God Bless!
notsarc,"It went out the window with the passage of the ""Partiot Act"".I said that I did not expect Robertson to be charged, did I not? However, I am not a lawyer nor that familar with the ""Patriot Act"". It is conceivable that he could be charged. I don't really know. But even if he COULD be charged, I certainly would not expect to see it."
notsarc,"based on what? i never said mr. horn did anything legally wrong. he was well within the rights of the state of texas. i never argued otherwise. that doesn't change the obvious fact that he intended to kill the two men, which is the topic of the discussion at hand."
notsarc,"No, not really. All that is different is the number of steps.  What is YOUR definition of 'macro-evoution'? Is it speciation? Or is it a brand new genus?  We have observed speciation, where new species happened."
notsarc,"arafat is not a worse leader than sharon... arafat steals millions in aid money that is suppose to go to the palestinians, which 80% of them are below the poverty line. arafat advocates people to xxxx themselves up so that they may kill as many jews as possible. he is the head-figure of many of these terrorist groups and pours millions of aid into them.  sharon is worse? not only has arafat contributed to many more than 1,000 israeli casualties, his 'intifada' has continued the cycle of violence and thus caused the death of more than 2,000 palestinians."
notsarc,did he? what secular evidence do you have from before 70 c.e. that confirms his existance? what is the outside verification to the new testament?
notsarc,"i've been following the story here all afternoon bbs. i'm sorry that you're going through this, but what has scotland done to upset radical islam ? nothing that i know of. could it be they have declared war on the west in general and as a whole ? i mean, i have been told over and over again how these radical moslems are just confused souls and the real enemies we must fear are the radical conservative christians like me who actually pray for the unsaved. talk about scary people, huh ?"
notsarc,"what did sanger say specifically that leads you to this conclusion? the preceding is from wikipedia. now, perchance, does 'cleaner' possibly mean having been exposed to enough medical information to be aware of veneral diseases so as to know how to avoid them? do you have an aversion to accurate information about stds being available?"
notsarc,then where do rights come from and how do you know they exist? i commented on the part i felt needed to be commented on.
notsarc,and the other two...? 'political disorder and confusion' is not the same as personal 'disorder and confusion'.
notsarc,"race is the elephant in the room of american politics. segregation is not official, but who can deny that de facto segregation does not exist in the usa? blacks stick to blacks and whites to whites. do you see any blacks in the tea party meetings? how many blacks voted for jon mccain in the last presidential elections?"
notsarc,"this is rather naive. who would willing condemn themselves to hell? many people commit sins regardless of the punishment. here's a little conversation to save time... i understand texas has the death penalty. are there any muders still going on? yes. why? who would condemn themselves to death? some people don't think they're going to get caught. they don't want to die themselves, but they just plain think what they do, they can get away with."
notsarc,what do you find disrespectful about it? maybe it is 'disrespectful' but i sometimes that's not necessarily so bad. i don't think it rises to the level of being offensive.
notsarc,"what is the big deal here? so eharmony doesn't cater to gays. (there are also gay-only services out there that don't cater to straights.) if anyone doesn't like the service, they don't have to use it."
notsarc,"along with some others here, you have missed the point. i know we all have the ability to file extensions for various reasons. i don't really care how much money they have. more power to them for being filthy rich. a candidate for president is supposed to reveal his (and spouse's) tax returns. teresa has apparently asked for an extension just to have it revealed after the convention. why?  is there anything to hide that would hurt kerry's chances of even being nominated? this has nothing to do with the average citizen."
notsarc,she is an attractive woman. what was she doing witha 14 yr old? she could probably walk into any local club or bar and pick up the man of her choosing.  does she have a specific thing for kids? will she do it again with another kid once this one grows up? if so she is a predetor. of coarse several hundred years ago kids of this age married and fornicated as part of everyday life. is our society that different than is was then?  i was a horn dog when i was 14. or at least wanted to be.
notsarc,"whether there's liberal parties in other countries is beside the point. there is no national 'liberal party' in the usa. if nato was suggesting the ny one, i hardly can be held responsible for not knowing 'their message'. i couldn't care less what it might be.  she said as much. let's see what happens next, shall we? i have a feeling she'll be amending the policy shortly."
notsarc,"And she was having unprotected sex? So she knew becoming pregnant was a possibility? Yeah, I could see that being condemned by pro-lifers."
notsarc,"correct. did you notice that in the scott peterson trial, the judge went around the law in deciding how he should be punished and who has rights? a clear sign of activism, yet none of the righties called him a activist judge even when what he did is by defintion activism. it's a sign they are hugely hypocritical.  vor's got a raging double standard if he calls some judges who do that activist and others who do the same, not."
notsarc,"the word touched me in a bad place... i think it was at summer camp or something... i'm still scarred.... no but seriously even i don't believe that... how exactly is word spiritual? is it intentional? based upon the interpretation an individual gets from it? seeing as how the history of the bible itself and it's original writings, many interpretations, denominations, and debates over itself is construed it can hardly be seen as itself being spiritual. is it possible that through god the manuscripts and texts stir inside a person a level of spirituality? yes. but when you go buy a bible at barnes and noble it certainly isn't glowing with the essence of god.... it's debated if even the ark of the covenant itself if it still exists has the essence of god to this day..."
notsarc,"EZ, if the concept of Gay Jesus offends you, why do you bring up the subject incessantly? You're the only one who does this around here. Truly bizarre.For example..."
notsarc,"if you check again you will find they do have self defense shootings in the list as well as accidents. the point is, as even you have now pointed out, the number is flawed. the source, vpc, knowingly used false data to further their claim. therefore eliminating any validity to their claim.  you and brady continue to trot out biased and inaccurate sources to back your arguement. you should stop, it does great harm to your credibility. wow, you really can leap tall mounds of logic in a single bound. what evidence do you have that any of these deaths would have been prevented by banning concealed carry? then also consider the lives saved by concealed carry, such as mine."
notsarc,"i totally agree. you never know what you might pick up. but he likes to eat hey? that's weird. but to each his own. i like to eat more normal food myself. but if you explore certain sides of someones personality, do you really learn anything? how do you know you just don't watch and then five minutest after you explore the personality, you forgot everything about that person. i mean, i don't know, but i have some trouble picking up on personalities right away of people i meet. has anyone ever tried spilling tuna on the floor on purpose? i'm just wondering because that would be weird."
notsarc,"To be honest...I don't know. But I do know that to argue something is false because the consequences are not desired is a logical fallacy (Appeal to Consequences).So is the argument I posted earlier (posted below for quick reference) true or false? And if false, why?A) Only science should be taught in science class (this is why creationism should not be taught in science class).B) Science is a collection of testable theories which have been thoroughly observed, identified, described, experimentally investigated and remain unrefuted.Conclusion: If A is true and B is valid then science class should only consist of testable theories which have been thoroughly observed, identified, described, experimentally investigated and remain unrefuted."
notsarc,"well, you ignored the part where i said 'voting'. but imo legislative solutions are part and parcel to popular appeal because legislators are voted in on that basis. any legislator claims to 'do what's right.' so elections tend to be popularity contests. and legislators tend to want to keep their constituents happy. oh and just to make sure you understand this kronos so as not to get off in the wrong direction, this is my opinion, just like everything else i've said. it is not a lie. how is that even relevant? i never claimed it was a first resort."
notsarc,"one idea per episode? there were always at least 4; one for each main character. and they always linked together perfectly. with the exception of a few episodes at the beginning and the last one, seinfeld was always gold.  the simpsons, on the other hand, has sucked for the last few years when they turned to the 'pick a celebrity guestspot' system."
notsarc,"i think that would probably create more problems than it would solve. how would we know? we don't punish. drunk drivers get off incredibly easy so much of the time. we have the weakest anti-drunk driving laws in the western world and we have the worst problem with drunk driving. coincidence? that's not all that far from what i've said. @joe- this is for a whole other discussion, but i think that the first step in aa is a big part of the reason of its low success rate. that's not too far from what i've said either."
notsarc,what? i assume one is within one rights to be anti-gun. that's all.
notsarc,"up to a point, but ther are things some people would consider 'wrong' that others would not. for example, most muslims would consider drinking alcohol to be wrong, while most non-muslims would not. some people believe it is wrong to hit someone, whether or not they have hit you, others believe you have a right to retaliate. some believe that sex is a big deal and should be reserved only for marriage, others believe any activity between consenting adults is morally ok. all of these are moral issues. which view should schools teach? should they teach that killing people is wrong? how about stealing? should they put things in context, so that stealing is only wrong in a society that recognises personal property. should they conflate morality with law? that opens yet another can of worms."
notsarc,"which one is this brady? the discredited kellerman study by the discredited kellerman? or the opinion piece of the rabidly anti-gun brady campaign? cite your sources. and answer the damn question already. is self-defense with a firearm an immoral act? it's not rocket science, there's only two answers; yes or no."
notsarc,"please clarify what you're saying here as it makes no sense to me. what point are you trying to make ? off the top though, any comparison you make with being black and homosexuality is false because the bible doesn't condemn being black but it does condemn the homosexual act/lifestyle. and who does the anti-defamation league promote hating ? i am unaware of it if they do it."
notsarc,"what specifically did he say to lead you to those conclusions? i don't know what speech you heard, but i have heard romney's religion speech as well as read it, and i see nothing there that declares war on secularism, or intimated that it's only believers who offer anything of worth, or that separation of church and state is bad. (in fact he defended separation of church and state.) the text of the speech is here (among plenty of other places accessible via google search) for people to draw their own conclusions."
notsarc,"we do? how do we know that? i will agree that there is not yet proof to make such a link, but i am unaware of proof that there is no link. did i miss something?"
notsarc,"If I want ""people"" to think? Kronos, the only one here who's making a big issue of whether or not I state the obvious here is you. You're the one making a big deal of it here. In a case where it's blatantly obvious, as in this one, then obviously there's an issue of homophobia here."
notsarc,"do they conver the same types of subject? i have, as yet, not heard much 'good' about american education (nor health), so it's interesting to hear about these things from the horse's mouth (so to speak)."
notsarc,do you think banning guns would stop people who wanted them from getting them? also you failed to address my point. is self-defense not a legitimate use for guns?
notsarc,"Did you read the article? A capuchin is type of monkey, in this case, the type that was used in the experiment."
notsarc,did you read the artical? to show our children that they are no different then any other.
notsarc,[quote=mae] land that didn't belong to the un or israel. or current american aggression? what's the difference? both are imposing their ideologies by force. you make it sound like choosing a sports team; for or against based on personal opinion.
notsarc,"how are they different? both can lead to depression, impaired judgement and decrease in ability. what is the difference? you can't just claim they are completely different and leave it at that. how are they different? you say i fail to provide how sleep [loss] can be just as violent as drugs. you or epaphras_faith have yet to prove that drugs can cause violence. i have just proved that sleep loss causes a decrease in ability and impairs judgement and leads to depression. you haven't proven anything more that drugs does."
notsarc,"who said pregnancy is the only bad thing? we already talked about ceverical cancer. furthermore, condoms don't always work...bad protection. maybe not, but wearing a bright red sign that says 'stalk me' sure will get the ones that are out there. your limited world shield you from the realities of life...which is really a bad thing i suppose but it gives a better reason to listen to your parents. aren't you a warm-hearted person you are in cancun talking to people on a pointless forum... does anyone else think this is rather odd?"
notsarc,"falling, did i say that 'the church alone provides for the needy?' if i did please point it out to me. each religion has its own place to turn, but none of them should ever be able to turn to the federal government. the constitution gives certain delegated powers to the federal government and handing money out for educational purposes is not one of them. socialism is merely the stepping stone into communism, and i don't want to see this nation start down that path. maybe i live by the constitution because it is 'the supreme law of the land.' the question is not why do i live by the constitution, but why don't you? until the constitution is replaced it will govern this land, and i plan to live by it."
notsarc,"So atheism doesn't ""need"" facts? If it claims to have complete knowledge of evolution, doesn't it need all the facts? If the answer is no, then how can it argue against religion? Miller didn't explain it."
notsarc,"i'm concerned with u.s. history. i'd rather go back 200 years. i'll see what i can find - out of time tonight however.  isn't the big bang part of evolution? i don't notice atheist authors, or the aclu, using it in politics much.  what else can influence morals?"
notsarc,"a cop tried that in school and got sued and lost, a private individual will get sued for assault, and false imprisonment at the least. there are more cases each day but one thing the justices did mention was marbury v madison. you can ignore an illegal law with impunity. we have the ruling. we also have past cases quoted in the h eller and mcdonald cases. you implied there were none and that is false. would you like to take a stab at nunn v, state of georgia for instance? star gazer cited a lower court ruling that the gun grabbers used just as sinjin used an earlier, oveturned case in people v zirillo. how can you miss so much?"
notsarc,"do we want to have control over ourselves? some religios fanatics dont, and thats what im saying. i dont know much on this matter, im only 14. but, ive been to a conservative catholic school, and ive seen what it's like. its a narrow minded hellhole."
notsarc,"rrriiigggghhhtttt.... do you really think your opposition to ending medicare / medicaid would just come from the recipients? no. it's like kids being afraid of getting their haircut. it's much adieu over nothing. and then when the haircut is done, they realize it's not as bad as they made it out to be... and they eventually recognize the need for the haircut..."
notsarc,"so what? jefferson is a prime example in opposites and double standards. he believed in freedom but owned slaves. wrote the declaration of independence yet only believed in freedom for white men not women or people of color. this stance is very consistent with his double standard. he was also an adulterous, womanizer who had sex with his slave women and producing children who would remain slaves. so there again is his double standard he enslaved his own children."
notsarc,the iranian govenment was visibly anti-american. did the filipino and dutch cases have that component? i am still quite convinced that americans would hate iran just as much as they accidentally caused american casualities.
notsarc,"can you support this moronic statement? the answer is obviously no. also, why should obama be less responsible for his own words on guns and religion than palin is for the words of her audience? the media will follow palin through the gates of hell and beyond to find something to demonize her. what lengths won't they take to attack republicans?"
notsarc,"if the distinction matters, then what is your point about promiscuity, exactly? misinformation msleads people into thinking that if the significantly curtail the number of partners they have sex with, that they would eliminate the chance of contracting disease. that is not true. it just takes one time with an infected person. protection is what people should be arguing. it would be much better if people were upfront about sex and sexuality, upfront about their hiv status, and used protection at all times during sex."
notsarc,"Quite frankly, that makes absolutely no sense.So conservatives in the blue states will buy more porn because why? Cause they are in a blue state?And liberals in the red states will buy more porn because why? Cause they arein a red state?Your excuses lack any cogent theory behind the scenario.In science, when people put forth a hypothesis they provide a basis for their claim as to the mechanics of the phenomenon.But with you, you just throw out different ideas with no basis."
notsarc,"Ever been to eastern KY? Many of the residents share a very strong faith in the christian religion. They also share abject poverty, malnutrition and starvation, substandard or absent medical care, contaminated water supplies, and dangerous and often poorly heated / ventilated ""housing"". Yes Easy, truly their cups overfloweth."
notsarc,"so you are asking how a gravitational field overcomes the intertia of a less massive object placed within said field? i don't know but your question kind of confused me: in this example the only reason the object is not moving is because you are exerting an opposing force to counter that which the warped space has induced on the object (gravity). all that has changed when the object is released is it can accelerate freely and we can observe the resulting notion. i see what you are getting at- the question could be rephrased as how is an object in a region of warped space constantly under an acceleration towards the centre of the gravitional field, the strength of which depends upon the size of the bodies and the distance separating the two?"
notsarc,"Again, would you please show how this limits anyone's speech in any way? This is just paper work that lobbyists need to fill out, it's not infringing on any rights in any way. You are totally free to buy people to push your agenda, you just need to document that that is what you're doing."
notsarc,"i don't follow. 'since those of specific faith...' ???? if you don't believe god, then there is no sin. those that do would choose neither of the above over another. of course, there are some here that would, but that's religion for you."
notsarc,Used against me? I never denied this. Surely you refer to this in terms of gay marriage. Considering I don't believe gay marriage is a right I don't see how my words do you any good.
notsarc,"you have to be kidding me. you don't really believe this, do you??? sure they may have white people on from time to time, but obviously they exclude white people since you can turn it on and almost always see only black people. so the criteria of whether something is racist or not is whether or not there is a 'single culture' behind it? i don't see why having a culture behind it is really relevant. things can be racist or not independent of whether there is a culture there."
notsarc,could you see language evolving in non social animals? it wouldnt have a reason to.
notsarc,take it up with who brought it up. who said the idea of it being 'scientific' is the criteria for a theory to be taught in schools?  schools have to have some degree of autonomy to have the curriculum they want without over-regulation. who sets the standard of what's 'scientific' or not?
notsarc,So why are you so afraid of it? If it is bad you will have a choice to go to a private insurance company.
notsarc,it did not because it was not clear till the 1970s that horizontal gene transfer was something to be considered. nobody knew the mechanism till that era. and of course hgt is just another form of variability to be taken into account. genes transfered horizontally are as subject to selection as anyother form of gene. once intergrated into the recieving genome they are simply one more heritable element and if they alter the phenotypes (many are either neutral or even inactivatee) then of course they are subject to selection. why do you think otherwise? remember that horizontal transfer is a rare event roughly on a par with ordinary mutations.
notsarc,Why do you oppose gay marriage? The traditional definition of marriage is as a contract for the purchase of a bride. The wedding is what is sacred. What you are doing is no different than those who opposed marriage betwen people of different races or beliefs as well. You have no valid reason to oppose it either.
notsarc,"That's a completely different issue jo. If those pro gay sites were accurately translating and interpreting the bible as it intended itself to be translated, I would accept it with open arms. But how can I accept the lies that homosexual apologists attempt to tell by distorting Gods truth in order to justify their sin? You should understand that I can't allow that rather than you using those corrupted sources in order to support what you personally want the bible to say. I welcome anyone to take the content of the links that tell each story within my link above, and disregard the info if any opposing info is found regarding the claims they make. But just attacking it because it's a jewish source is ridiculous."
notsarc,"have you ever burned a flag? have you ever urinated on a pow flag? i thought you said you never did, so i don't see how i am lambasting you for something you have never done. but do you honestly believe it is ok for any person to urinate on a pow flag just because they think they have a good reason to do it? you said it's their judgment call, right? do you see it as disrespectful or sad like i do?  just because you can, doesn't mean you should."
notsarc,When is wealth redistributed on a whim? The NHS is one of the few good things to come out of WWII and is the mark of a fair society (if you ask me). Restricting health-care according to wealth is despotic....
notsarc,"i don't think much can be inferred about the relationship between guns and crime by comparing the crime rate of a densely populated city with the crime rate of a whole state. virginia has a higher homicide rate that most canadian provinces which is probably a better comparison-  homicide offences, number and rate, by province and territory is it possible to make it much harder for criminals to obtain guns? yes, i think so. if your boat is sinking then you have to plug all the leaks not just some of them. if you keep plugging the leaks then eventually you'll reach a state in which significantly fewer criminals are obtaining guns. why do i say this? because significantly fewer criminals are obtaining guns in developed countries with stricter and more consistent gun laws. in the us, there is too much inconsistency in gun laws."
notsarc,why would anyone want to use aspartame? drink tea or coffee without sweetener or sugar..you get used to it. if you are too fat then eat less.
notsarc,so? the assertion was 'evolution is based on evidence - what do you have' suggesting that one side has 'evidence' and the other none. i am simply 'balancing' it out by showing that the assertion isn't black vs white as made out.
notsarc,obviously i don't have a perfect memory or even that i read what you are referring to. why don't you give me a flavor of their 'factual errors?' and are you talking about their news sections or their opinion pieces? and who wrote it? sometimes in the opinion pieces these are submitted by authors in the nations that are the subject. perhaps this was written by a swedish politician who had an ax to grind.
notsarc,"what? you didn't know that religious people are the only ones that are supposed to be silent and never try to take part in democracy, while everyone else gets to do so? where have you been? emoticonxdonno  i wonder sometimes if opponents of religion really even stop to think about what they're really saying."
notsarc,what's your opinion of religious people who believe evolution is merely a part of creation?  there are non-literal creationists out there in large numbers.
notsarc,"don't have to change locations for that the majority of the nuts are outside of the institions, i've had my fair share.. thieves bold enough to come in while everbody's home..... true..but the gender most affected? males...."
notsarc,"religion is nothing but a choice but is constitutionally protected. why? blacks and homosexuals are two different classes, unless you are a black gay. it is the way each class is treated that is the same. coservative christians view gay people in the same way as the white supremacists view black people. the more religion attacks gay people and our civil rights the more i am begining to believe that the romans had the right idea to rid the world of such filth."
notsarc,in the old testament people were punished for the sins they committed. i think he's asking why should we punish people while they are living? god will punish them when they die.
notsarc,"if they are used in reference to god, then how can you possibly say they don't refer to god??? jesus himself said he he and his father are one, in john 10:30. and the three appear together numerous times in parallel grammatical construction, denoting equality. it's a harder argument to make that the three are not god and that any one is lesser than the other in terms of divinity, than to say they are god."
notsarc,would you cite the exact article for once in your life? i'm sick of seeing the main page day after day after day.
notsarc,and you believe that to be what? you really need to just say who/what you think the creator is to save us from having to make all these clarification posts.
notsarc,"demon, that was quick were you right there? no resentment in my heart friend. i try to translate an expression from hungarian (again i guess that will be poor but i try anyway) 'friendship remains' (or 'unchanged' may be the better word?)  now here is what you asked:  that is a very good question demon, but i would put one more word there 'who'. no insult intended."
notsarc,which will push crude oil prices up in line with the benchmark usd devaluation? treasury interest rates could become interesting. i'm already seeing conventional cd and money market rates on the rise.
notsarc,"once again when is my life, what i do, and who i love, who i marry, any more thier business then theirs is to me? you still haven't answered my question. why do they get a say in my life yet i don't get the same say in their lives? anyone who wants to but into other peoples lives in the way these religious xxxxxx are is just cruel and evil. it is my life my family not theirs. they get theirs yet try and stop me from having mine that is unjust. you are defending an unjust system."
notsarc,"yeah you're saying what it isn't but not saying what it is. i'm not sure what you mean as physical either. can i ask you out straight -- are you suggesting a metaphysical component to 'you'? this questions just, i feel, needs to be answered because i'm still trying to grasp what your saying. to a degree? as soon as it changes you are something else surely? i would be wraith +1 or, after a heavy night out wraith -20 -- the 'wraith' bit is just seemingly a conveniance to show nothing more than perceived lineage -- i'm not the same frame of refference at any given point as i was a second ago. i might as well be called cow +20 after eating, and assimilating a beef burger, the lineage part really is quite meaningless."
notsarc,"there is one major difference between the democratic spending plans and the republican plan (for this election cycle anyway): dems want to repeal the tax cuts, so they have a methodology for paying for all of this. oh, and they haven't been too keen on sending men to mars either. and just a quick aside, was it legal to invade iraq? probably, b/c of the legislation broker cites. but i think he makes a logical leap when he extrapolates 'justified' from 'legal.' the calculus used to say this was a 'just' war is a very dangerous one, and if cross-applied could justify innumerable conflicts (how many nations can legitmately say that another nation has 'dangerous activities' that make it pose an 'imminent threat'? at the very least, the entire mid-east (arab/israel) would explode under that logic)."
notsarc,let's wait and see if the chain of possession comes to light.  your demand that any tightening of our firearm sales regulations must curtail all cartel bloodshed. who do you suppose the mexican president hopes to protect from guns arriving from the us?  i am prepared to offer my fingerprint every time i purchase a firearm and so should you. to exclude ourselves from those prohibited from buying.
notsarc,"can you think of the mental trauma of having your rapists baby? and then caring for it? for rape victims, no i still don't think abortion should be the first choice, but it should be available."
notsarc,"if genesis in the bible is not a literal account of creation (i,e., six days, man from dust, fruit of good and evil) then what is its use? why include as the foundation of the entire bible a story that is either totally fabricated, or mostly inaccurate/metaphorical? genesis 1&2, in the literal application, has 2 vitally important concepts that the entire bible is totally useless without: 1. god is sovereign and totally limitless in power 2. man has disobeyed god and is in need of reconciliation everything else in the entire bible rests on these 2 premises. now if genesis has it wrong, then what is the use of any of the rest of the bible? from all scientific perspective, genesis 1&2 never happened, and here the validity of the entire bible is questioned."
notsarc,"d. adams? :)  this is, of course, an entire debate unto itself. i fully concede that logic dictates that we accept the possibility of life elsewhere. but that it's probable? we simply don't have the data to make that leap. we've got some good theories about how life started here, but we don't know exactly what happened. and even if we did, we don't know how common those conditions are 'out there'. if the conditions for life to arise are so bizarre that they only occur once every 20 billion years, and for all we know they might be, than we may well be the only life in the universe. logically, we just can't say. we don't have enough info to apply logic to the problem."
notsarc,"really? so suppose that you have two models for the way the solar system works. you measure where the planets are today in the night sky, and you use both models to predict where the planets will be ten years from now. in ten years you make actual measurements. the predictions of the first model for mars are off by, say, a tenth of a minute of arc. the second model is off by a hundredth of a minute of arc. (for comparison, the full moon in the sky has a width of about 30 minutes -- i may be wrong about this). so, are you saying the first model is wrong? the error seems to be pretty tiny (by most standards). what about the second?"
notsarc,"ok, so none can be shown. how many people with a life sentence without parole have died an prison and been innocent?  my point being that a mistake doesn't make the sentence not worth having. in fact, with the death penalty you get more due process than someone with a life sentence...there aren't many advocates for helping those guys out."
notsarc,i concede that it can go to a ballot. you have been arguing that such an issue should go to a ballot.  care to comment on the second point i made? to some extent this thread is about whether anyone should be concerned that all the petition signers realized what they were signing (in the context of proven wide-spread fraud on the part of the signature gatherers).
notsarc,"Yes, and George Dubya Bush and the GOP know it's unconstitutional.Would it really bother you so much if the feds recognized a Massachusetts or California or New York or New Jersey same-sex marriage while other states like Alabama and Utah could ban same-sex marriage?I could live with that. Most gay people already leave those states anyway."
notsarc,"do you know what a fatwa is ? the burden of proof is on those who want an invasion, iran can not prove that is not trying to develop a nuclear weapon. you can not prove a negative. honestly i don't think people have learned the lesson from the iraq war.  what did we hear before that invasion from the warmongers in the us and uk ?  the exact same thing we are hearing at the moment. that the regime is evil, they have wmd, they have links to aq etc surely the people are not dumb enough to fall for the same tripe again ?"
notsarc,"then why is it that closeted homosexuals that are completely unknown to be gay commit suicide at such a high rate? they aren't persecuted or harassed at all since no one knows they are even having these feeling? it is self loathing that feeds their desire to harm themselves. people who know that what they are is right and good, don't harm themselves at all, but defend and support who they are even when persecuted by others. that's how it was for me when i converted from islam to christianity. all of the persecution i received just made me stronger."
notsarc,"that is a specious argument. the constitution is not an embodiment of what is good and evil for humans to do, but of what is of value in a free society. the constitution does not judge the goodness and badness of human character. ideas for laws come from morality? the concept of morality came from a desire to survive as we evolved. so you see the law preventing someone from interfering with your life as the same as the law allowing someone to interfere with your life?"
notsarc,"you havent answered my question. if evolution is lacking the hard, observable evidence you say it's lacking, then surely you should have lots to say about atomic theory. however, you dont. why not? unification theory is different - theres no dependency on that theory like there is with chemistry or biology."
notsarc,"originally posted by fracas only way to be more efficient is to continue to wage war preferentially against technologically similar sides are we back to a us-eu war? sorry i took that the wrong way, but regardless, the kind of thinking that leads to wars and seeing who has the largest most powerful military is precisely what i'd like to get away from in order to advance the military. yes we learn from war, but its wasteful, i'm proposing a not so wasteful military."
notsarc,"jito, i forgot to thank you for agreeing with me on eugenics. what is that?...the second or third time we have ever agreed? well, you have only 8,966 more things to agree on with me to show you have converted to proper thinking! emoticonxangel  consent is relevant when it is relevant. do you deny that women engaging in sexual intercourse (outside of rape or some other type of coercion) give consent to engage in an act that may result in pregnancy? i never said that sex was only for procreation and i don't believe it is. i do believe, however, that the procreative potential of sex must be respected. i do believe that when a being comes about as the result of a sexual act then that being should be respected."
notsarc,"just how many cases do you want to read that says exactly what i am quoting? i just gave you a taste of things to come...like the right to be left alone. even the 10 year census, all that is required by the xivth amendment i: 1. number of people who live there 2. sex of each 3. age of each that completes the enumeration and registration for the census. i will ask the 3rd time before i cover you up with cases, show me the enumerated power of any branch of government to require a person to register any right, much less firearms."
notsarc,"read the rest of the post. i added to it before you responded to make what i said clearer: why would you be maligning them if they were not bad? the intended effect is that you would deserve the same maligning you were giving since what you were doing was equally as bad. since you malign something bad, it is generally understood to mean that the speaker considers you to be as bad as those you malign."
notsarc,you want sources saying that bo had 2 communist parents? voted to the left of socialist sanders?? is loved by cpusa was mentored by rev. wright and frank marshall davis?? supports single payer??? tell us which is propaganda???
notsarc,"Our side? I don't get the impression we're on the same side.Besides, I think the subject is decreasing the number of unwanted pregnancies."
notsarc,what would make e-mail any easier? both the forum and most e-mails have spell checks. wouldn't e-mail be harder to use since referencing specific paragraphs be really difficult? sounds like trying to organize it over e-mail would be a logistical nightmare.
notsarc,"Yes, but I think you missed my point. I stated this above, remember the prohabition? People actually drank MORE alchohal. Without a ban, law abiding citizens and criminals will have them, with a ban, there will be just criminals."
notsarc,does the grand canyon strike you as a 'crack' as well? like? what makes them so dangerous if it ain't their guns and their willingness to use them?  this assumes that no da is presently going after them. something i highly doubt.  diversionary tactic on your part. wouldn't making guns harder for them to acquire be helpful?
notsarc,"ms. bennet, in your opinion, is the anglican church apostolic? if so, what is the case that it presents for apostolic succession? the roman church did not start as an imperial church. the empire wasn't around for 300 years or so. i think many martyrs of the faith would differ with that assertion. it started at peter's appointment as the foundation of the church and was solidified in the upper room after jesus' resurrection. why do you desire to receive communion at a catholic church?"
notsarc,"I posted two versions:1. I am a rational being. Is it logical to assume that a rational entity formed me? (not my parents--on a mankind scale) Is it more logical than to assume that I generated out of inanimate matter incapable of logic? Generated due to ""miraculous"" odds? I'm not sure what the numbers are. I think the logical sequence is a belief in a higher power rather than a springboard to logic from a primordial soup of nothing.2. I came up with a belief in the supernatural via natural logic--I am a rational being. I could not have therefore come from irrational combinations of inanimate matter that somehow combined to form rational animate matter. I came from a rational source."
notsarc,"do you realize, that the fetus has only recently not been defined as a human being. back when birth control first came out, planed parenthood wanted to make sure it would be leagle. so they redefined 'life' to say that you had to draw breth. by the way have you ever seen any pictures of the aborted babies? 'cause they sure like humans to me. you know most of them can already move before the abotion? look into the court hearings of judge ricard c. caey in new york. if you want to know the truth about abortion."
notsarc,Folding proteins... Show me where and how this happens. Why is it that one protein is able to fold into the right shape to attach itself to another? If this is happening all the time we'd see more mutations all the time.Good theory you've got there. Saying something can happen doesn't mean that it does!
notsarc,separate but equal is never equal? which are better? boys' or girls' bathrooms? other than that last statement i agree 100%. i don't believe gay civil unions are separate but equal but i do believe they could be if we wanted them to be. unfortunately the people who seem to only be against redefining marriage and for civil unions never want to give gays all the rights of marriage in a civil union.
notsarc,"take a look at your post no. 80 time-stamped 6-26-06 09:55am wherein you said ...in response to my post #79 wherein i said: does that not comply with my claim that you change what i say? back in post #77, i requested that you quote and debunk the links. you merely scoffed at them (as i expected). prior to initiating any other question to me or introducing a tangential argument, please explain the above. i'll be back next week."
notsarc,"what if it's got nothing to with bigotry? what if, like religion, it takes absolute proof in order to be believed? i think that's what it's going to take. don't you?"
notsarc,"so their support of bush (so you say) means exactly what? that they were listening to the sound bytes dished out by bush's rhetoric? and where is bush is the man and jim's trucking? usually they're all over it when someone says something bad about the american people. oh, that's right... it's ok when a person on the right says it, it's when it said by a liberal like moore that it becomes an issue."
notsarc,"but that doesn't answer the question. why is dawkins a xxxxx to believe as he does? it seems that you have no answer except to throw out indiscriminate insults at people you know nothing about. in a previous post you stated, 'the guys a simpleton.' that doesn't make sense as there is no verb in the sentence. 'guys' is the plural of 'guy'. you don't seem to be aware that the contraction for 'guy is' is 'guy's.' your error is caused by ignorance whereas trebor's is clearly a typo caused by the proximity of the 'e' and 'd' keys. do you have a better explanation for our origins that doesn't involve magic and dirt?"
notsarc,"bin laden said on that tape that muslims should support iraq. why? iraq is secular. he shouldn't want iraq to be supported... he hates non-muslims. hmm... thistown, who cares what people think? it's a bad idea to set foreign policy by opinion polls. 85% of our population was opposed to entering ww ii before pearl harbor while hitler was killing millions, and we knew all about it. that was the wrong thing to do.  i bet the chancellor is relaxing with a cool glass of french wine waiting for his term to end...his people hate him. he's holding his stance to gain popularity, playing politics. our president blew him off, he's killed relations, and he knows it."
notsarc,"and how does this differ from life insurance or car insurance? or for credit cards, for that matter? the cost of a policy, or card, is proportional to the risk assumed by the insurer. don't want to pay high premiums, take the risk on yourself. period. i find it morally unacceptable to steal money from people in order to satiate another's morality. we have no god-given right to live forever as far as i know."
notsarc,"if someone is an attorney or in law enforcement, would you please give an interpretation? thank you."
notsarc,"morals are what you make them to be. for example, 'it's ok to kill youths if they've insulted your prophets' is another possible one. the ones in my joshua example? he doesn't tell them, nor did i say that he told them. look at what i said: 'the morality of the old testament peoples (god included) is definitely questionable.'. however, in the next chapter he does immediately reward them, by protecting them from the angry reprisals of the neighbouring villages: '5 then they set out, and the terror of god fell upon the towns all around them so that no one pursued them.' note that in the other examples, god is either commanding it (through the proxy of a speaker) or directly doing it (pillar of salt, bears etc)."
notsarc,"So you feel that Mrs Vo should have been allowed to run the risk of dying?  Your statement ""An abortion never has to be done"" only holds true if you place the value of the unborn child over that of the mother in all cases. Do you really believe that?"
notsarc,Well do you mean Texas or Texans? Because Texas holds the record for execusions in the US. Not something I'd be proud of.
notsarc,"it is silly to focus on the tools and not bad people who misuse these tools, especially when the tools in question can be easily smuggled as well as made in a modestly-equipped machine shop. also, why do many of those who supposedly have a political orientation that favors freedom and opposes tyranny want to severely and arbitrarily limit the rights of tens of millions of people who have not, and show no indication of wanting to, unjustly hurt anyone with these tools?  it is wrong to tell people that they cannot put certain substances in their bodies and have abortions, just as it is wrong to tell people that they cannot have certain precision-machined metal/polymer/wood objects in their own homes."
notsarc,"do you have any evidence of this that doean't come from a biased christian website? so here is where you are saying nanny, nannie, poo,poo my straight realtionship is better than your gay relationship. how? some big claims, can you provide some substance to them, in other words can you back this up with some data? that doesn't come from some christian baised study."
notsarc,"economically it is great. heck, it would even be better if robots did all our jobs for us at almost no expense. sure the corporations would be fine with that because they would profit but what about the average person who cannot find a job? sending jobs over seas doesn't hurt our economy but it doesn't help billy who lost his job to it. i'm not suggesting that we stop outsourcing jobs but i am suggesting that while our jobless rate increases that our government do something to keep some jobs here."
notsarc,"that's an interesting observation. by what means are you reasonably sure? do you think the other religions have the same take on it as you do? i used to think the same: if there is only one god, then they had to be worshipping the same, just giving him different names. then i was introduced to matt.7. clearly god only wants identifying (ex.6:3, 15:3 etc.) and worshipping one way, therefore all other religions have to be wrong. just a thought."
notsarc,"and as i've already pointed out, this notion that god needs to glorify himself smacks of narcissism on a cosmic scale. why would god in any way need -- or even want -- to demonstrate his glory? he's god: he knows how glorious he is! isn't that enough? and again, as already pointed out, i don't find arbitrary salvation of an undeserving few to be merciful, nor do i find arbitrary damnation of an undeserving many to be just. the calvinist vision of god strikes me as a celestial tyrant."
notsarc,"And what if he had said fiance? Would you have suddently admitted that their love is real? Pointing out a different word choice than you would have used doesn't appear to mean anything.If you are certain that their love is not real, why don't you explain your reasoning that led you to this conclusion? It seems to me that a gay person knows his own love better than someone who has never even met that gay person. Do you have some knowledge which disagrees?"
notsarc,"So what? That means in a firefight with police, the criminal will run out of ammunition in a matter of seconds and be ripe for the picking."
notsarc,"exactly who are you saying has revised the bible? and with that question asked, i believe by admitting that if it was revised to delete the meat of it, it would be equally diluted in power, content and strength.  really? if you're speaking about jefferson still, then why didn't he recommend that all punishments for homosexuality be erased from the law completely, and homosexuality be legalized at that time? that would have been the just and magnanimous thing to do if he believed such tripe as you attribute to him."
notsarc,mind if i ask if you drive yet? if so do you have any points on your license? 2mph seriously isn't a huge ammount and neither your speedo or the mobile cameras are usually calibrated to be that accurate.
notsarc,"your previous posts never mentioned underage sex with middle age men. underage sex is underage sex, dont try to move the goalposts. why the last five years? you asked if i had children because i stated that modern slasher films were as dangerous as simulated paedophilia. why did you ask?"
notsarc,"did you not say, 'these people need to be stopped?' or was that still part of the article? if that was you, then that is a viewpoint that, if implemented, will directly influence public policy. you say you do not want to make this country a theocracy, right? well, do you want to make it/keep it a non-theocracy? if so, you are trying to extend/keep an ideology imposed through government. i'm not saying that is bad; i am only saying it is what it is."
notsarc,"good one, johnhanks. (glad you included the 'pleased with the outcome' part). :p  what about the emotional aspect? the moral aspect? again - we are leaving religion out of it. au fait?  not talking about religion on this part either, now john. as i stated earlier: what is a piece of paper to two people in love?"
notsarc,"the government has no business invading into the private, legal activities of two individuals. and how is requirement able to defeat straw purchasers? if you don't feel comfortable making the sale, don't make it. it's as simple as that."
notsarc,"even with tax deductible status, i seriously doubt there's enough of a market available yet to make privatization a going concern. since all people will ostensibly benefit from whatever flows from the space program, it seems like government is still the only option now. sure, the russians are capitalizing on their experience by taking citizens for rides, but what are they really learning or advancing there? they're getting more and more vocal about us funding their stupid space station. the europeans are primarily interested in the lucrative satellite-launching business; again, where's the hard science? so it seems to fall to the americans -- surprise. but if we don't do it, the chinese certainly will. in all probabilities, they will be fierce competitors, imo."
notsarc,"because it shows that your data is not absolute, and that there is supporting evidence for both sides? it also stops you justifiably saying things like... the data speaks for itself. in america, guns save more lives than are taken by them. fact. did you know that in the uk, i am statistically at least twice less likely to be killed than you? fact. it works both ways..."
notsarc,"Pro-choice? Why do you assume I'm pro-choice? I often play devil's advocate...I was using china as an example to show you that people when desperate, trying to get around laws (in this case the 1 child law), will abandon their children to death in the gutter -- it was unrelated to abortion laws -- it was an illustration of as aspect of human nature, which you deny."
notsarc,"but aren't the exchanges primarily aimed at those who can't get insurance otherwise? i would have thought that if insurance was so little used by young people, insurers would be keen to get their business, and premiums would be low. maybe insurance is more necessary for young people than you think?"
notsarc,"Don't be so faithful in our laws. Remember prohibition? Of course, I myself highly doubt that Obama will manage to ban firearms, but mark my words, he will do anything in his power to restrict them."
notsarc,That just sounds alarmist to me. Do you realize the actual implications of taking away second amendment rights? It is just not going to happen.
notsarc,"now isn't that a terribly socialistic position to take? but, i'm confused by it at the same time, for socialists like you don't really want to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs now do you? emoticonxrolleyes when logic fails, there's alway ad hominem, right? and the ad hominen continues..... we're larger, more diverse, more litigious, need i go on? leaving the continued ad hominem aside, one of the causes for our high healthcare costs is litigation. since the dnc survives on the money derived from the blood-sucking trial lawyers lobby, i don't see real reform occurring until we cut those purse strings along with the big pharma's."
notsarc,"if i recall correctly, many of the fires were started at about the same time, so more than one person seems likely. and weren't they mostly black churches that have been targeted? i wouldn't discount racism as the motive."
notsarc,if you want to use this arguement then you are assuming a right to free speech seperate from the 1st amendment. you are applying the first amendment but rather assuming 'free speech' is a right granted outside of the constitution. i believe our argument is dealing with applying the first amendment to the states. the case didn't deal with the first amendment at all. where did you get that idea from? it dealt with religion but that is about as close as it gets. ok? was there ever any doubt that the 1st amendment was incorporated since cantwell?
notsarc,where did you get this from? i want to read it.
notsarc,"Inconsistent how? If you give me specific quotes of mine that were inconsistent, I will be more able to respond. I never said I didn't know. I said there is no empirical evidence. That is not synonymous with not knowing. The word ""proof"" as I am using it is subjective. What if proof enough for me is not for you. What is proof for me is not empirical. According to my definition, I have proof. It's just not proof that you will accept. It comes down to a simple difference of epistemology. I believe that personal metaphysical evidences can be accepted, you don't. End of story."
notsarc,"do you mean when pelosi said the protestors had nazi banners, when they were actually banners saying 'no' to nazism? she's in the democrats. you mean the fantasy land whitehouse version of the proposals, that no one has actually read? no one that understands the constitution would say that, that's a very ignorant comment. what's perverted is that you think freedom of speech means the people have to shut up while they listen patiently to the government propaganda machine."
notsarc,are you trying to say that people of faith cannot tell the difference between myth and reality? i'm actually confused by this sentence.
notsarc,Thats an odd analogy. Can a child survive without its mother? I'd say a baby is no less dependent on its mother the first few years than it is when in it grew in the womb.  Is the child still a parasite then?
notsarc,"He had ALREADY MADE the animals. ""now the Lord God HAD FORMED..."" not ""now the Lord God formed..."" See the difference? He already HAD FORMED the animals before he brought them to Adam. He made the animals before Adam."
notsarc,"if you want the benefits of marriage, get married. but you ought to be able to marry a person of your choice. your suggestion would be to marry someone i don't want to me married to, that is a different thing. it is not using 'that logic'. i thought marriage was supposed to mean something to you. isn't it supposed to mean a commitment with rights and responsibilities? i am not proposing that anyone enters into that commitment lightly. i happen to think that's a bad idea. people get married for many reasons, some of which i would feel are not good reasons, but i would not make it illegal to do so.  i am talking about the right to marry a person of your choosing."
notsarc,So you are saying that the democrats have no choice but to inaugarate Brown and let him stop the bill? You suggest that whatever option they pick will be political suicide.
notsarc,"But is the gun that you keep in your home a greater risk to yourself or to a potential intruder? It's pretty easy to find information on the FBI and the CDC websites that shows that more people die in gun accidents than criminals die in legally justifiable self defense shootings. People defending guns often only look at the gross benefit of gun ownership, not the net benefit when it comes to safety. That would make about as much sense as only looking at your gross income while ignoring the fact that your net income is negative."
notsarc,"could you clarify the italicized sentence for me, please? i don't understand if you are saying that the fetus takes priority or not. if so, why?thanks...monday morning fogginess."
notsarc,"backpedaling? how's that? my original answer is that it's wrong to force children to have sex with old men. that is my answer still. where has it changed? in fact, each post i've made is an affirmation of the one before it. how is that backpedaling? there are absolute goods and evils. that is, there are certain things that are good or bad. how is that saying something different? certain things are bad. period. just like certain things are wrong, no matter how many people think that they aren't wrong. period. is that clear enough for you? i hope so because that's what i've been saying all along and you'd have to be high to think i've changed my position."
notsarc,"you guys just don't get it do you? this isn't about an attack on christianity. this isn't about anti-christians, and in the end, this isn't about the cross, or any other religious symbol for that matter, offending anyone. this is about keeping religion from meddling with government, but just as, if not more, important, it is about keeping government from meddling with religion, and the moment they intertwine, there are possibilities for many dangerous things to happen. and by the way, i'm a christian, and i don't want my government in any way defining any part of what i hold dear. p.s. sandycane- most buddhists aren't in india."
notsarc,"best interests of the nation as opposed to what? other people outside it? i reject any notion that one nation should be promoted regardless of the effects on others. faithful to what exactly? if an oath makes you do something you wouldn't otherwise do, it makes you a slave. if it doesn't make you do anything you wouldn't otherwise do, it is pointless anyway."
notsarc,You said who would it hurt? I'm asking you who would it hurt if there was prostituion? Just to help you think that there are injuries that are proximate to everyone.
notsarc,"Actually, what gay marriage proponents simply want is to be treated like every one else. Denying the right to marriage because of his/her sexual orientation makes them second class citizens. The supporters of the anti-gay movement simply want to impose their moral values on to the rest of the public, the recent prop 8 ballot initiative proves it. Ever read John Locke or JS Mill? You should, it's what our country ideals are based on. You have your bubble and I have mine so just leave me alone; and the majority are never always right and should not have a say in what is moral or just based on their beliefs."
notsarc,You have any examples of that? Shooting people for throwing rocks and eggs at houses that is.
notsarc,"1) i dont recall saying anything that i believed 2) someones experiences should definitly be looked at you are just one rude person. i was just sharing an experience my mom had teaching. not only that, youe are comparing a pedophiliac to a gay man adopting. what does this prove? i never said all striaight families are perfect and i never said all gay families are bad either. all i stated was one persons direct observations on the situation. how many child of gay couples have you taught? observed? 30 years worth? i believe i will take someones experience over you being rude."
notsarc,your right about the 14 year old and the ten year old but if it is a 18 and 14 should that be legal? or 18 and 15? 16 and 21 is legal (although it is wrong) because the youngest one is still legal. age of consent = 16 years old. if your basing it on a year gap what about 10 years? i am 10 years older than my fiance. before anyone jumps to conclusions i am 38. and she is 28. legal? why? we are both over 16.......period.
notsarc,"have you ever considered the possibility that he cares about you? that he knows you? and that he cares about those in the womb? this is always the charge hurled at me but it is never founded. you cannot find any misogyny in my writings but rather a great respect for women and their value and dignity. this is why i argue so strongly against abortion. yet, any oppression, or insecurity, or hardship, or difficulty they face, though real and challenging, is not justified in the face of destroying the life in the womb. though abortion reigns freely and forcefully and abundantly still the oppression and abuse of women endure. one reason they endure is that people are looking in the wrong place for a solution--they are looking to abortion when it offers no solution."
notsarc,"what laws? as far as i know you are allowed to do so. w/o the ordinance though.  i'm familiar w/ mr. konsen's paper, but i shy away from so broad a definition. i think defining 'arms' as weapons that may be carried by a man a good, and true definition."
notsarc,"As in we, do you mean we the USA or we, the World ? Because this is a World wide issue and not something the US can solve on its own in any case."
notsarc,"That who knows? Your use of ""we"" does not include many religious folk I assume. I would claim to know of much interaction that God has and has had with the world."
notsarc,"State money, but no state accountability...yea right.Private schools don't even have to hire certified/qualified teachers! Oh come on? That's a travesty."
